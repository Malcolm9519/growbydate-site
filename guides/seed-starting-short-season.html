        A simple, reliable method for planning indoor starts and transplant timing.

    <section class="card">
      <p>
        In a short growing season, timing matters more than almost anything else.
        Starting too late limits harvest. Starting too early creates stressed,
        overgrown seedlings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal isn’t to guess. It’s to plan backward from your
        <strong>average last frost date</strong> and build a clear window for:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Starting seeds indoors</li>
        <li>Hardening off</li>
        <li>Transplanting or direct sowing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>

      <h2>The 3 Dates That Matter</h2>

      <h3>1. Average Last Frost Date</h3>
      <p>
        This anchors your spring schedule. Most warm-season crops are transplanted
        1–3 weeks after this date.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Indoor Start Window</h3>
      <p>
        Many warm-season crops need a 6–10 week head start indoors. Count backward
        from your last frost date to determine when to sow.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Hardening Off Period</h3>
      <p>
        Plan 7–10 days before transplanting to gradually expose seedlings to
        outdoor conditions. Skipping this step can slow growth significantly.
      </p>

      <h2>Which Crops Should You Start Indoors?</h2>

      <p><strong>Usually started indoors:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Peppers</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Kale</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Usually direct sown:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Radishes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In shorter seasons, starting warm-season crops indoors is often the
        difference between harvest and disappointment.

      <h2>Common Short-Season Mistakes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Starting too late.</strong> Waiting until spring feels safe, but it shortens your harvest window.</li>
        <li><strong>Starting too early.</strong> Overgrown seedlings struggle after transplant.</li>
        <li><strong>Skipping hardening off.</strong> Sudden outdoor exposure causes shock.</li>
        <li><strong>Growing too many long-season crops.</strong> Prioritize what reliably finishes in your climate.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>A Practical Planning Method</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>Identify your average last frost date.</li>
        <li>List the crops you want to grow.</li>
        <li>Mark indoor start weeks (6–10 weeks before frost for warm-season crops).</li>
        <li>Add 7–10 days for hardening off.</li>
        <li>Set transplant or direct sow windows.</li>
      </ol>
