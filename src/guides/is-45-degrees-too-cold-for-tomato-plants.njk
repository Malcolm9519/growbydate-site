  <h1>Is 45 Degrees Too Cold for Tomato Plants?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    45°F (7°C) won’t freeze tomatoes — but it may slow them down.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Tomato plants can survive 45°F (7°C), but growth slows noticeably below 50°F (10°C).</strong>
    A single cool night at 45°F is usually not fatal, yet repeated exposure can delay development and weaken early establishment.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>No — 45°F (7°C) is not immediately fatal to tomato plants.</strong>
    However, it is below their preferred growth range.
    If nights stay at or below 45°F (7°C) for several days, tomatoes commonly stall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Survival is likely.
    Strong growth is not.

  <h2>What Happens to Tomatoes at 45°F (7°C)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Root activity slows</li>
    <li>Nutrient uptake decreases</li>
    <li>Leaf growth pauses</li>
    <li>Plants may develop a purple tint</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The plant remains alive, but internal processes shift into a low-efficiency mode.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Where 45°F Fits in the Tomato Temperature Range</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>60–75°F (16–24°C):</strong> ideal growth</li>
    <li><strong>50–59°F (10–15°C):</strong> slower but acceptable</li>
    <li><strong>45°F (7°C):</strong> borderline, growth slowdown</li>
    <li><strong>40°F (4°C):</strong> stress likely</li>
    <li><strong>32°F (0°C):</strong> freeze damage risk</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    45°F sits above the stress zone but below the active growth range.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Repeated 45°F Nights Matter</h2>

  <p>
    A single cool night is rarely serious.
    Several consecutive nights below 50°F (10°C) can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Delay flowering</li>
    <li>Reduce early fruit set</li>
    <li>Extend time to harvest</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short-season climates, even small delays can affect total yield.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Air Temperature vs. Soil Temperature</h2>

  <p>
    Even if air temperatures rebound during the day,
    cold soil can continue slowing growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tomatoes establish best when soil temperatures are at least
    <strong>60°F (16°C)</strong>.
    If soil remains cool, root development lags.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do If 45°F Is in the Forecast</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cover plants overnight if exposure will repeat</li>
    <li>Use row cover to reduce heat loss</li>
    <li>Water earlier in the day (moist soil retains warmth)</li>
    <li>Reduce wind exposure where possible</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

    review <a href="/guides/when-to-transplant-seedlings-outdoors/">When to Transplant Seedlings Outdoors</a>
    for frost-based timing logic.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do If Tomatoes Already Experienced 45°F</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Monitor new growth for 3–5 days</li>
    <li>Avoid fertilizing immediately</li>
    <li>Maintain steady moisture</li>
    <li>Allow temperatures to stabilize before judging setbacks</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Growth usually resumes once nights consistently rise above 50°F (10°C).

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Will 45°F (7°C) kill tomato plants?</summary>
    <p>
      No. Tomatoes typically survive 45°F, but growth slows.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is 45°F safe for transplanting tomatoes?</summary>
    <p>
      It’s survivable, but not ideal. Consistent nighttime lows above 50°F (10°C) are safer.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can tomatoes recover from repeated cool nights?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes, once temperatures warm — but early growth may be delayed.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is soil temperature more important than air temperature?</summary>
    <p>
      Both matter. Cold soil slows root establishment even if daytime air warms.
