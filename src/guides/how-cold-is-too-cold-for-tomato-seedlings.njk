  <h1>How Cold Is Too Cold for Tomato Seedlings?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Tomatoes don’t need frost to get set back — cold nights are enough.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Tomato seedlings begin slowing below 50°F (10°C) and experience stress below 40°F (4°C).</strong>
    A brief dip may not kill them, but repeated cold nights can delay growth and reduce early yield.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Tomato seedlings are “too cold” for strong growth below 50°F (10°C).</strong>
    Below 40°F (4°C), stress symptoms are common.
    At 32°F (0°C), freeze damage can kill seedlings outright.
  </p>

  <p>
    Survival and healthy growth are not the same thing.
    Tomatoes often survive chilly nights — but they lose momentum.

  <p>
    Use these practical cutoffs when deciding whether to transplant or protect:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>60–75°F (16–24°C):</strong> ideal growth range</li>
    <li><strong>55–59°F (13–15°C):</strong> acceptable, slightly slower growth</li>
    <li><strong>50–54°F (10–12°C):</strong> noticeable slowdown</li>
    <li><strong>40–49°F (4–9°C):</strong> stress likely</li>
    <li><strong>33–39°F (1–4°C):</strong> injury risk increases</li>
