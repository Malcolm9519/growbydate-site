  <h1>How Cold Is Too Cold for Tomato Seedlings?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Tomatoes don’t need frost to get set back — cold nights are enough.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    Tomato seedlings can survive chilly weather, but “survive” isn’t the same as “grow.”
    If nights are too cold, growth stalls, stress symptoms appear, and transplant success drops.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Tomato seedlings are “too cold” below 50°F for growth and below 40°F for stress risk.</strong>
    A brief dip to 40°F may not kill a tomato seedling, but it can cause stunting and delayed development.
    At <strong>32°F (freezing)</strong>, tomato seedlings can be killed.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re deciding whether to transplant, the safest baseline is:
    <strong>wait for consistent nighttime lows above 50°F</strong>.

  <h2>Tomato Seedling Temperature Thresholds</h2>

  <p>
    These cutoffs are practical for planning:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>60–75°F:</strong> ideal growth</li>
    <li><strong>55–59°F:</strong> acceptable, slower growth</li>
    <li><strong>50–54°F:</strong> growth slows noticeably</li>
    <li><strong>40–49°F:</strong> stress likely, recovery time possible</li>
    <li><strong>33–39°F:</strong> injury risk increases</li>
    <li><strong>32°F and below:</strong> freeze danger</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The colder it gets, the more “time-to-recover” you should expect, even if the plant doesn’t die.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Cold Stress vs. Frost Damage</h2>

  <p>
    Tomato seedlings can look “fine” after a cold night and still suffer a setback.
    Cold stress is more about slowed internal function than visible injury.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Cold stress (40–50°F):</strong> stalled growth, delayed establishment.<br>
    <strong>Frost/freeze (32°F and below):</strong> tissue damage or death.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Signs Your Tomato Seedlings Got Too Cold</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Purple tinting (especially undersides of leaves)</li>
    <li>Yellowing or dull, gray-green leaves</li>
    <li>Leaf curl or droop that persists after warming</li>
    <li>No new growth for 7–10 days</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    One symptom doesn’t always mean permanent damage — the key is whether new growth resumes once nights warm up.
  </p>

  <h2>When It’s Safe to Transplant Tomatoes</h2>

  <p>
    The simplest rule that prevents most problems:
    <strong>transplant when nights are reliably above 50°F</strong> and the forecast is stable for at least a week.
  </p>

  <p>

  <h2>What to Do If a Cold Night Hits After Transplanting</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cover plants before sunset to trap warmer air</li>
    <li>Use frost cloth or row cover (avoid plastic touching leaves)</li>
    <li>Water earlier in the day so soil holds heat overnight</li>
    <li>Reduce wind exposure with a temporary barrier</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If lows approach the mid-30s, treat it as a serious event and prioritize protection.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do If Tomato Seedlings Are Already Stressed</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Wait 48–72 hours before pruning or “fixing” anything</li>
    <li>Keep soil evenly moist (not waterlogged)</li>
    <li>Hold fertilizer for about a week</li>
    <li>Look for healthy new growth before making big changes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Many tomatoes recover — but the setback shows as a delayed timeline.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can tomato seedlings survive 40°F overnight?</summary>
    <p>
      Often yes, but stress is likely. Repeated 40°F nights commonly cause stunting and delayed growth.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is 45°F safe for tomatoes?</summary>
    <p>
      It’s survivable, but not ideal. Growth slows and establishment can be weaker if this repeats.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How warm should nights be before I plant tomatoes?</summary>
    <p>
      Aim for consistent nighttime lows above 50°F, with no near-term cold snaps in the forecast.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does cold soil matter if the days are warm?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Cold soil slows roots and makes the plant behave like it’s under stress even in good daytime weather.

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Below 50°F, tomatoes slow down. Below 40°F, stress risk rises.</li>
    <li>Survival is not the same as strong growth and early yield.</li>
    <li>Protect transplants or delay planting if cold nights persist.</li>
