  <h1>How to Start Seeds in a Cold House</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Temperature influences germination. Timing influences everything else.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>You can start seeds in a cold house, but soil temperature and light must be managed carefully.</strong>
    Cool indoor conditions slow germination and increase the risk of weak growth. Adjusting placement, timing, and crop choice often solves most problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before changing equipment, confirm your indoor start window with the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>
    to avoid extending indoor time unnecessarily.

  <h2>What Counts as a “Cold House”?</h2>

  <p>
    For seed starting, a cold house typically means:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Indoor temperatures below 65–68°F (18–20°C)</li>
    <li>Cool basements</li>
    <li>Rooms with limited heating</li>
    <li>Seed trays placed on concrete floors</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even if the air feels comfortable, seed trays may be several degrees cooler at soil level.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Germination Temperature Guidelines</h2>

  <p>
    Different crops prefer different soil temperatures:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Warm-season crops:</strong> 70–85°F (21–29°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cool-season crops:</strong> 55–70°F (13–21°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If soil remains below optimal range:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Germination slows</li>
    <li>Sprouting becomes uneven</li>
    <li>Seeds may rot in overly wet soil</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

    <a href="/guides/do-you-need-a-heat-mat-to-start-seeds/">Do You Need a Heat Mat to Start Seeds?</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Placement Makes a Difference</h2>

  <p>
    Small adjustments can raise soil temperature several degrees.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Move trays off concrete floors.</li>
    <li>Place trays on insulated surfaces.</li>
    <li>Use interior rooms instead of exterior walls.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even a modest temperature increase improves germination consistency.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Light Becomes Even More Important</h2>

  <p>
    Cool homes often coincide with early-season starts when daylight is limited.
  </p>

  <p>
    When temperature slows growth but light is weak:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Seedlings may stretch</li>
    <li>Growth becomes uneven</li>
    <li>Stem strength declines</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

    <a href="/guides/how-much-light-do-seedlings-need/">How Much Light Do Seedlings Actually Need?</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Warm-Season Crops in Cold Houses</h2>

  <p>
    Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant are most affected by cool indoor conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    In cold houses:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Germination may take longer.</li>
    <li>Seedlings remain smaller.</li>
    <li>Extended indoor time increases stretch risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Starting too early magnifies these problems.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Cool-Season Crops Are More Forgiving</h2>

  <p>
    Broccoli, cabbage, kale, and lettuce tolerate cooler indoor conditions better.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of these crops can also be direct sown closer to your frost window, reducing indoor dependency.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Timing Reduces Equipment Dependence</h2>

  <p>
    In colder northern regions across the U.S. and comparable Canadian climates, seeds are often started in late winter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier starts mean:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Colder indoor environments</li>
    <li>Lower light intensity</li>
    <li>Longer indoor duration</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Starting closer to your transplant window often improves seedling quality more than increasing equipment.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do If Germination Is Slow</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Increase soil warmth modestly.</li>
    <li>Check moisture — avoid saturated soil.</li>
    <li>Verify seed freshness.</li>
    <li>Consider starting warm-season crops slightly later.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Patience is often sufficient for cool-season crops.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can seeds germinate at 60°F (16°C)?</summary>
    <p>
      Many cool-season crops can. Warm-season crops may germinate slowly.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will seedlings grow slower in a cold house?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Lower temperatures slow metabolic processes and growth.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is this different in Canada?</summary>
    <p>
      The principles are identical. Indoor temperature determines outcomes.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I just start earlier to compensate?</summary>
    <p>
      Usually not. Earlier starts extend indoor time and may reduce quality.
