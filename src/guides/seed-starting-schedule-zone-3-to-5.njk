  <h1>Seed Starting Schedule for Short Growing Seasons (Zones 3–5)</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Frost-based timing for gardeners with limited warm months.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    In short growing seasons, timing is everything.
    Starting too late limits harvest. Starting too early creates weak, overgrown seedlings.
  </p>
  <p>
    The key is aligning indoor seed starting with your average last frost date.

  <h2>What Counts as a Short Growing Season?</h2>

  <p>
    Most gardeners in Zones 3–5 have:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Late last frost dates (often May or early June)</li>
    <li>Early fall frost dates (September in some areas)</li>
    <li>90–120 reliable growing days</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This narrow window makes transplant timing especially important.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 1: Confirm Your Last Frost Date</h2>

  <p>
    Your average last frost date determines when seedlings can safely move outdoors.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you don’t know yours, start here:
    <a href="/guides/how-to-find-your-last-frost-date/">How to Find Your Last Frost Date</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you know that date, you can count backward to determine indoor start times.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>General Indoor Start Timing (Zones 3–5)</h2>

  <p>
    These are typical indoor seed starting ranges before your last frost date:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Peppers:</strong> 8–10 weeks before last frost</li>
    <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> 6–8 weeks before last frost</li>
    <li><strong>Broccoli & Cabbage:</strong> 6–8 weeks before last frost</li>
    <li><strong>Lettuce:</strong> 4–6 weeks before last frost</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Crops that mature slowly benefit most from early indoor starts in short seasons.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Starting Too Early Backfires</h2>

  <p>
    Many short-season gardeners try to “get ahead” by starting seeds far too early.
  </p>

  <p>
    The result:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Leggy, weak seedlings</li>
    <li>Root-bound plants</li>
    <li>Transplant shock</li>
  </ul>

  </p>

  <p>
    Strong seedlings come from correct timing — not extra weeks indoors.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Plan Backward From Transplant Date</h2>

  <p>
    In Zones 3–5, your transplant date may already be late spring.
    That makes precision important.
  </p>

  <p>
    A simple method:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Identify your average last frost date.</li>
    <li>Add 1–2 weeks for warm-season crops.</li>
    <li>Count backward based on each crop’s recommended indoor start window.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    To simplify this process, use the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>
    to calculate exact indoor start dates based on your frost timing.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Hardening Off in Short Seasons</h2>

  <p>
    Begin hardening off seedlings 7–10 days before transplanting.
  </p>

  <p>
    See:
    <a href="/guides/how-to-harden-off-seedlings/">How to Harden Off Seedlings</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Because the outdoor window is narrow, avoid rushing this step.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Focus on Fast-Maturing Varieties</h2>

  <p>
    In short seasons, crop selection matters.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Choose tomato varieties under 70 days to maturity.</li>
    <li>Select compact or early pepper varieties.</li>
    <li>Consider cold-tolerant greens for early planting.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Matching variety maturity to your frost window reduces risk.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Know your last frost date.</li>
    <li>Count backward based on crop timing.</li>
    <li>Avoid starting seeds too early.</li>
    <li>Harden off gradually before transplanting.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short growing seasons, precision matters more than enthusiasm.
