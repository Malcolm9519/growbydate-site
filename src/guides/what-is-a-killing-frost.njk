  <h1>What Is a Killing Frost?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    A killing frost causes widespread plant death — not just surface damage.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>A killing frost occurs when temperatures drop low enough and remain cold long enough to destroy most annual plants.</strong>
    This usually happens when temperatures fall well below 32°F (0°C), often into the mid to upper 20s (-2°C to -4°C).

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>A killing frost is a freeze severe enough to kill the majority of tender plants.</strong>
    While light frost may damage leaves, a killing frost destroys plant tissue throughout stems and growing points.
  </p>

  <p>
    It typically occurs when:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Temperatures drop below 28°F (-2°C)</li>
    <li>Cold persists for several hours</li>
    <li>Soil and air temperatures remain low overnight</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Light Frost vs Killing Frost</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Light Frost:</strong> Around 32°F (0°C), patchy leaf damage</li>
    <li><strong>Hard Freeze:</strong> 28°F (-2°C) or lower, widespread freezing</li>
    <li><strong>Killing Frost:</strong> Severe freeze that ends the growing season</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A killing frost often coincides with the first hard freeze of fall.

  <h2>What Happens to Plants During a Killing Frost</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Ice forms inside plant cells</li>
    <li>Cell walls rupture</li>
    <li>Water-soaked tissue collapses</li>
    <li>Growing points die</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Tender annuals such as tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and basil rarely survive.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Temperature Thresholds</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>32°F (0°C):</strong> Light frost possible</li>
    <li><strong>30°F (-1°C):</strong> Increased damage risk</li>
    <li><strong>28°F (-2°C):</strong> Hard freeze likely</li>
    <li><strong>Below 25°F (-4°C):</strong> Severe tissue destruction</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Duration matters. A brief dip may cause less damage than several hours below freezing.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>When Killing Frost Happens</h2>

  <p>
    In cold climates across northern U.S. states and comparable Canadian regions,
    the first killing frost typically occurs in early to mid-fall.
  </p>

  <p>
    This date defines the practical end of the growing season for tender crops.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do Before a Killing Frost</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Harvest mature produce</li>
    <li>Cover sensitive plants if possible</li>
    <li>Bring containers indoors</li>
    <li>Remove irrigation timers if freezing persists</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once a killing frost passes, most annual crops will not recover.

  <h2>Spring Killing Frost Risk</h2>

  <p>
    In spring, a killing frost can occur after a warm period.
    This is why average last frost dates reflect probability, not certainty.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>At what temperature is a killing frost?</summary>
    <p>
      Often 28°F (-2°C) or lower, especially if temperatures remain low for several hours.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can plants recover from a killing frost?</summary>
    <p>
      Most tender annuals do not recover once stems and growing points freeze.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is a killing frost the same as a hard freeze?</summary>
    <p>
      They are closely related; a killing frost is severe enough to end the growing season.
    </p>
