  <h1>What Temperature Is Safe to Transplant Peppers?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Peppers are less forgiving than tomatoes.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    Pepper seedlings can survive cool nights, but they often don’t recover quickly.
    Transplanting too early can lock in stunting that lasts the rest of the season.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>For most gardeners, peppers are safe to transplant when nighttime lows stay above 55°F and soil temperatures are at least 60°F.</strong>
    If nights are regularly below 50°F, transplanting peppers is likely to cause a major setback.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re choosing between “plant now” and “wait a week,” peppers usually reward waiting.

  <h2>Temperature Thresholds for Pepper Transplants</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>65–85°F:</strong> ideal growing range</li>
    <li><strong>55–64°F nights:</strong> acceptable for transplanting</li>
    <li><strong>50–54°F nights:</strong> risk of stunting</li>
    <li><strong>Below 50°F:</strong> avoid transplanting</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Soil temperature matters because peppers need warm roots to establish.
    Cold soil can stall them even if daytime air temperatures look “fine.”
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Peppers Stall When It’s Too Cool</h2>

  <p>
    Peppers are warm-season crops with a strong heat requirement.
    When nights are cool:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>root growth slows</li>
    <li>nutrient uptake weakens</li>
    <li>flowering can delay later</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is why “they didn’t die” can still turn into “they never took off.”
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Hardening Off Is Not Optional</h2>

  <p>
    Even at safe temperatures, peppers need a gradual transition outdoors.
    Skipping hardening off often causes droop, leaf scorch, and slow recovery.

  <h2>What to Do If Temperatures Drop After You Transplant</h2>

  <p>
    If peppers are already planted and a cold night shows up in the forecast, aim to reduce heat loss:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cover plants before sunset with frost cloth or row cover</li>
    <li>Keep soil slightly moist (not dry, not waterlogged)</li>
    <li>Add mulch to stabilize soil temperature</li>
    <li>Reduce wind exposure</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A single cool night may be recoverable, but repeated cold nights often cause the lasting stall.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do If You Transplanted Too Early</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Protect on cold nights for the next 1–2 weeks</li>
    <li>Don’t push fertilizer immediately</li>
    <li>Watch for new growth at the center of the plant</li>
    <li>Consider replanting if growth doesn’t resume after warming</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can peppers survive 50°F nights?</summary>
    <p>
      They can survive, but growth often slows sharply. Repeated 50°F (or below) nights commonly cause stunting.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is soil temperature more important than air temperature?</summary>
    <p>
      Both matter. Cold soil prevents roots from establishing, which is why peppers can stall even during warm days.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I wait two weeks after frost to plant peppers?</summary>
    <p>
      Often yes, especially if your climate has cold nights after the last frost date. Use nighttime lows as your guide.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will row covers make early transplanting “safe”?</summary>
    <p>
      They reduce risk, but they don’t fully replace stable warm nights. Covers help most when cold is brief.
    </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Peppers transplant best with nights above 55°F and soil at 60°F+.</li>
    <li>Below 50°F nights, stunting risk rises fast.</li>
    <li>Use covers if a cold night hits after planting.</li>
  </ol>
