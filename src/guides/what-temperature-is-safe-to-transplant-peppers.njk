  <h1>What Temperature Is Safe to Transplant Peppers?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Peppers tolerate warmth — not cold nights.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Peppers are safest to transplant when nighttime temperatures stay above 55°F (13°C) and soil temperatures are at least 60°F (16°C).</strong>
    Below that range, peppers often stall. They may survive, but growth can slow for weeks.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>For most gardeners, peppers are safe to transplant once nighttime lows consistently stay above 55°F (13°C).</strong>
    If nights are regularly below 50°F (10°C), transplanting peppers usually leads to stunting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Soil temperature matters just as much as air temperature.
    Aim for soil temperatures of at least <strong>60°F (16°C)</strong> before moving peppers outdoors permanently.

  <h2>Pepper Temperature Thresholds (Air & Soil)</h2>

  <p>
    Use these practical cutoffs when deciding whether to transplant:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>65–85°F (18–29°C):</strong> ideal growing range</li>
    <li><strong>55–64°F (13–17°C) nights:</strong> acceptable for transplanting</li>
    <li><strong>50–54°F (10–12°C) nights:</strong> risk of slowdown</li>
    <li><strong>Below 50°F (10°C):</strong> avoid transplanting</li>
    <li><strong>32°F (0°C):</strong> freeze damage likely</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    One cool night may be manageable.
    Several cool nights in a row often cause lasting stunting.

  <h2>Why Peppers Stall in Cool Weather</h2>

  <p>
    Peppers are more cold-sensitive than tomatoes.
    When nights drop below about 55°F (13°C):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Root growth slows sharply</li>
    <li>Nutrient uptake decreases</li>
    <li>Leaf growth pauses</li>
    <li>Flowering may be delayed later in the season</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The plant may look “alive,” but internal growth processes slow down significantly.
    That lost momentum is difficult to regain in short growing seasons.
  </p>

  <h2>Air Temperature vs. Soil Temperature</h2>

  <p>
    Many gardeners check only the forecast low.
    But cold soil can stall peppers even if days are warm.
  </p>

  <p>
    If soil remains below 60°F (16°C), roots establish slowly.
    Raised beds cool faster overnight than in-ground soil, and exposed sites lose heat more quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    If nighttime air is borderline, wait until soil warms as well.

  <h2>Hardening Off Still Matters</h2>

  <p>
    Even at safe temperatures, peppers need gradual outdoor exposure before transplanting.
