  <h1>Why Seedlings Get Leggy (And How to Fix It)</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Leggy seedlings are usually a light or timing problem.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Seedlings become leggy when they stretch toward insufficient light.</strong>
    Warm temperatures, long indoor periods, and starting seeds too early all increase the risk. Most leggy seedlings can recover if corrected early.

  <h2>What “Leggy” Means</h2>

  <p>
    A leggy seedling has:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Long, thin stems</li>
    <li>Wide spacing between leaves</li>
    <li>A tendency to lean toward light</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This stretching is a natural response called phototropism — the plant grows toward its light source.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>The Primary Cause: Insufficient Light</h2>

  <p>
    Once seeds sprout, light becomes the most important growth factor.
  </p>

  <p>
    If light intensity is too low:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Seedlings elongate rapidly.</li>
    <li>Stem tissue becomes weak.</li>
    <li>Leaf development lags behind height.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    South-facing windows can work, but late winter daylight is often weaker than expected.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Temperature Makes It Worse</h2>

  <p>
    Warm indoor air accelerates growth. When warmth combines with weak light, seedlings stretch quickly.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Above 70°F (21°C): Faster vertical growth</li>
    <li>Cooler (60–65°F / 16–18°C): Slower, sturdier growth</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Bottom heat is useful for germination but should be reduced once seedlings emerge.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Starting Too Early</h2>

  <p>
    Legginess often begins with timing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting seeds far earlier than your transplant window extends the time seedlings must survive indoors — often during low-light weeks.
  </p>

    <a href="/guides/starting-seeds-too-early/">What Happens If You Start Seeds Too Early?</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Warm-Season Crops Are More Vulnerable</h2>

  <p>
    Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant spend 6–10 weeks indoors.
    That longer window increases risk if light is marginal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool-season crops like broccoli and cabbage often transplant earlier and spend fewer weeks inside, reducing stretching risk.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>How to Fix Leggy Seedlings</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Increase light intensity immediately.</li>
    <li>Lower room temperature slightly.</li>
    <li>Move lights closer to seedlings.</li>
    <li>Provide gentle airflow to strengthen stems.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Tomatoes can often be planted deeper at transplant time, which compensates for extra stem length.
  </p>

  <p>
    Severely stretched seedlings may not fully recover, but early correction usually improves structure.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Short-Season Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    In colder northern climates across the U.S. and comparable Canadian regions, seeds are often started earlier in the calendar year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier starts mean:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Lower sun angles</li>
    <li>Shorter daylight hours</li>
    <li>Weaker natural light</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In these conditions, precise timing matters more than extra equipment.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Preventing Leggy Seedlings</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Start seeds according to realistic transplant timing.</li>
    <li>Provide strong, close light immediately after sprouting.</li>
    <li>Avoid extended bottom heat after germination.</li>
    <li>Keep indoor temperatures moderate.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Proper timing reduces the number of weeks seedlings depend on indoor light.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can leggy seedlings be saved?</summary>
    <p>
      Often yes, if corrected early. Increase light and moderate temperature.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Are tomatoes the only crop affected?</summary>
    <p>
      No, but long indoor crops are more vulnerable.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will a fan help?</summary>
    <p>
      Gentle airflow can strengthen stems but does not replace adequate light.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is this different in Canada?</summary>
    <p>
      The underlying causes are the same. Indoor light and temperature drive the outcome.
    </p>
