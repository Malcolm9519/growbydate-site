  <h1>When to Transplant Seedlings Outdoors</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Use frost timing — not the calendar — to choose the right date.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    Moving seedlings outdoors at the right time determines whether they thrive or stall.
    Transplant too early and frost may damage them. Transplant too late and you shorten your harvest window.
  </p>
  <p>
    The correct transplant date is based on your average last frost date and the type of crop you’re growing.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Step 1: Know Your Average Last Frost Date</h2>

  <p>
    Your average last frost date is the anchor for transplant timing.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you don’t know yours, start here:
    <a href="/guides/how-to-find-your-last-frost-date/">How to Find Your Last Frost Date</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Warm-season crops should generally go outside after this date.
    Cool-season crops can often tolerate light frost and may go out slightly earlier.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Cool-Season vs Warm-Season Crops</h2>

  <h3>Cool-Season Crops</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lettuce</li>
    <li>Broccoli</li>
    <li>Cabbage</li>
    <li>Kale</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These can often be transplanted 1–2 weeks before your average last frost date,
    depending on weather conditions.
  </p>

  <h3>Warm-Season Crops</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Peppers</li>
    <li>Eggplant</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These should be transplanted after your average last frost date,
    and ideally once nighttime temperatures remain consistently above 50°F (10°C).
  </p>

  <h2>Use Indoor Start Dates to Plan Backward</h2>

  <p>
    Transplant timing begins weeks earlier when you start seeds indoors.
  </p>

  <p>
    If seedlings are started too early, they may become root-bound or leggy before it’s safe to plant them outside.
  </p>

  <p>
    To align your indoor start dates with your transplant window,
    use the <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Harden Off Before Transplanting</h2>

  <p>
    Seedlings grown indoors need gradual exposure to outdoor conditions before being planted in the garden.
  </p>

  <p>
    Begin hardening off 7–10 days before your planned transplant date.
  </p>

  <p>
    See:
    <a href="/guides/how-to-harden-off-seedlings/">How to Harden Off Seedlings</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Skipping this step increases the risk of transplant shock.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Watch Actual Weather, Not Just Averages</h2>

  <p>
    The average last frost date is a guideline, not a guarantee.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before transplanting:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Check the 7–10 day forecast</li>
    <li>Avoid nights near freezing for warm-season crops</li>
    <li>Delay planting if a cold snap is predicted</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If frost is forecast unexpectedly, cover plants or bring containers indoors.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Signs Seedlings Are Ready for Transplanting</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Several sets of true leaves</li>
    <li>Strong, thick stems</li>
    <li>Healthy root development (not root-bound)</li>
    <li>Successfully completed hardening off</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Seedlings that are too small may struggle outdoors.
    Seedlings that are too large may experience transplant stress.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Base transplant timing on your average last frost date.</li>
    <li>Cool-season crops tolerate light frost; warm-season crops do not.</li>
    <li>Harden off seedlings before planting.</li>
    <li>Check actual weather forecasts before transplanting.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Accurate transplant timing improves survival, growth, and overall yield.
