  <h1>When to Start Seeds Indoors</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Understand the timing first. Then calculate it.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    <strong>The correct time to start seeds indoors is determined by your average last frost date.</strong>
    This guide explains how to calculate your start window by counting backward from that anchor date. Most warm-season vegetables require 6–10 weeks indoors before transplanting, while many cool-season crops need 4–6 weeks or can be direct sown.

  <h2>Start With Your Last Frost Date</h2>

  <p>
    Your <strong>average last frost date</strong> is the typical final spring freeze in your area.
    It is based on historical probability, not certainty.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Some years frost ends earlier.</li>
    <li>Some years frost lingers.</li>
    <li>Elevation and exposure can shift local timing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you don’t know your frost date, see
    <a href="/guides/how-to-find-your-last-frost-date/">How to Find Your Last Frost Date</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>The Basic Formula</h2>

  <p><strong>Indoor start date = last frost date − recommended indoor weeks</strong></p>

  <p>Example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Last frost: May 15</li>
    <li>Tomatoes: 6–8 weeks indoors</li>
    <li>Start window: March 20 – April 3</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal is to have seedlings ready for transplant — not oversized plants waiting indoors.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you prefer not to calculate dates manually, the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>
    applies this formula automatically for each crop.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Warm-Season vs Cool-Season Crops</h2>

  <h3>Warm-Season Crops</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Peppers</li>
    <li>Eggplant</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These require warm soil (around 60°F / 16°C or higher) at transplant.
    Starting too early rarely helps unless transplant timing changes.
  </p>

  <h3>Cool-Season Crops</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Broccoli</li>
    <li>Cabbage</li>
    <li>Lettuce</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These tolerate light frost and can often be transplanted earlier.
    Many are also suitable for direct sowing.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Temperature Matters More Than Calendar Dates</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Below 50°F (10°C): Warm-season crops stall.</li>
    <li>Below 40°F (4°C): Cold stress becomes likely.</li>
    <li>32°F (0°C): Frost damage possible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If transplant timing does not shift, starting seeds earlier only extends indoor time — it does not extend the growing season.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Starting Too Early Backfires</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Leggy growth from light limitations</li>
    <li>Root-bound seedlings</li>
    <li>Higher risk of damping off</li>
    <li>Transplant shock from overgrown plants</li>
  </ul>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Adjusting for Short Growing Seasons</h2>

  <p>
    In colder climates across northern U.S. states and comparable Canadian regions,
    starting earlier does not automatically solve short-season challenges.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Choose earlier-maturing varieties.</li>
    <li>Transplant at proper soil temperatures.</li>
    <li>Use light frost protection strategically.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Indoor timing only helps if it meaningfully advances transplant timing.
