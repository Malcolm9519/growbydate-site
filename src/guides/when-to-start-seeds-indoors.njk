  <h1>When to Start Seeds Indoors</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Count backward from your last frost date to get a clean, reliable start window.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    Starting seeds indoors at the right time makes the whole growing season easier.
    The key is simple: use your average last frost date as an anchor, then count backward by the number of weeks your crop needs indoors.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you already know your last frost date, you can skip the math and use the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>
    to get crop-specific start dates.

  <h2>Step 1: Find Your Average Last Frost Date</h2>

  <p>
    Your <strong>average last frost date</strong> is the typical final spring freeze in your area. It’s a historical average — not a guarantee.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few practical notes:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>“Average” isn’t exact.</strong> Some years will be earlier or later.</li>
    <li><strong>Microclimates matter.</strong> Wind exposure, elevation, and urban heat can shift what you experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Short seasons make timing more important</strong> — but they don’t always mean starting earlier.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re not sure what your frost date is, see our guide on
    <a href="/guides/how-to-find-your-last-frost-date/">how to find your last frost date</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Step 2: Count Back From That Date</h2>

  <p>
    Most seed packets list indoor timing as “X weeks before last frost.”
    That’s your formula:
  </p>

  <p><strong>Indoor start date = last frost date minus the recommended number of weeks</strong></p>

  <p>
    Example: If your last frost is <strong>May 15</strong> and tomatoes need <strong>6–8 weeks</strong> indoors:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>8 weeks before May 15 → around <strong>March 20</strong></li>
    <li>6 weeks before May 15 → around <strong>April 3</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    That gives you a sowing window of <strong>March 20 to April 3</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’d rather not do this for every crop, use the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>
    and generate a schedule from your frost date.

  <h2>Why Starting Too Early Causes Problems</h2>

  <p>
    Starting early can feel productive, but it often creates avoidable issues:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Leggy seedlings stretching for light</li>
    <li>Root-bound plants in small containers</li>
    <li>Transplant shock from staying indoors too long</li>
    <li>Space and lighting limits</li>
    <li>More time for damping off and indoor pests to show up</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short seasons, the goal isn’t “earliest possible seedlings.”
    The goal is seedlings that hit the garden at the right time, at the right size.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Adjusting for Short Growing Seasons</h2>

  <p>
    Cold-climate gardeners often assume they should start everything earlier. Usually, that’s not the best lever to pull.
  </p>

  <p>
    Indoor start dates only help if they support a realistic transplant plan. In practice, you’ll get better results by focusing on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Transplanting at the right soil temperature (not just the right date)</li>
    <li>Choosing varieties that mature reliably in your window</li>
    <li>Using protection (row cover or a simple tunnel) when it actually changes transplant timing</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If your transplant timing doesn’t change, starting seeds earlier mostly extends indoor time — and that often reduces quality.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Cold Frames and Season Extension</h2>

  <p>
    If you use a cold frame, row cover, or low tunnel, you may be able to transplant a little earlier than your average last frost date.
  </p>

  <p>
    The important part is the direction of the adjustment:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Protection changes transplant timing.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Transplant timing changes indoor start timing.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re unsure, keep the seed start timing conservative and use protection as a buffer — not an excuse to start seeds months early.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>What if I don’t know my last frost date?</summary>
    <p>
      Start by looking up your average last frost date, then use that as your anchor.
      See: <a href="/guides/how-to-find-your-last-frost-date/">how to find your last frost date</a>.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I plant before my last frost date?</summary>
    <p>
      Sometimes, depending on the crop and protection. Cold-tolerant crops can handle light frost, but warm-season crops can’t.
      Treat last frost as a planning anchor, then adjust with real conditions.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if I miss my indoor start window?</summary>
    <p>
      You can buy starts, direct sow faster crops, or choose shorter-season varieties.
      Missing a week is rarely a problem — missing a month changes the plan.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I start seeds earlier in colder climates?</summary>
    <p>
      Usually no. Starting earlier doesn’t automatically extend your outdoor season.
      Focus on transplant timing, variety choice, and protection where it actually helps.
