  <h1>What Happens to Seedlings at 32 Degrees?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    32°F (0°C) is the freezing point — and that changes everything.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>At 32°F (0°C), water inside plant tissue can begin to freeze.</strong>
    Some cold-tolerant seedlings may survive brief exposure, but tender warm-season crops are at serious risk of damage or death.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>At 32°F (0°C), seedlings can experience freeze injury.</strong>
    Ice crystals may form inside plant cells, damaging tissue.
    Whether a plant survives depends on crop type, duration of exposure, wind, and microclimate conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Warm-season seedlings are highly vulnerable.
    Cool-season crops may tolerate a brief, light freeze.

  <h2>What Freezing Does to Plant Tissue</h2>

  <p>
    When temperatures reach 32°F (0°C):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Water inside cells begins to freeze</li>
    <li>Ice crystals expand and rupture cell walls</li>
    <li>Damaged tissue collapses once thawed</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Damage often appears the next morning after thawing:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Blackened or darkened leaves</li>
    <li>Water-soaked, limp foliage</li>
    <li>Collapsed stems in severe cases</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The longer the freeze lasts, the greater the injury.

  <h2>Cool-Season vs. Warm-Season at 32°F</h2>

  <h3>Cool-Season Seedlings (Some Tolerance)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Kale</li>
    <li>Spinach</li>
    <li>Broccoli</li>
    <li>Cabbage</li>
    <li>Onions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These crops can often tolerate a brief light freeze,
    especially if hardened off and not exposed to wind.
  </p>

  <h3>Warm-Season Seedlings (High Risk)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Peppers</li>
    <li>Cucumbers</li>
    <li>Squash</li>
    <li>Basil</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    At 32°F (0°C), these plants may suffer severe injury or die.

  <h2>32°F vs. 35°F: Why Those 3 Degrees Matter</h2>

  <p>
    At 35°F (2°C), plants are stressed but tissue usually does not freeze.
    At 32°F (0°C), freezing can begin.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>35°F (2°C):</strong> metabolic slowdown</li>
    <li><strong>32°F (0°C):</strong> possible ice formation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Calm, clear nights increase frost risk because heat escapes rapidly from soil and leaves.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>How Long Is Too Long at 32°F?</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Brief dip (under 1 hour):</strong> possible survival for hardy crops</li>
    <li><strong>Several hours:</strong> high injury risk</li>
    <li><strong>Prolonged freeze:</strong> likely fatal for tender seedlings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Low-lying areas often experience colder temperatures than forecast.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do If 32°F Is in the Forecast</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cover plants before sunset with frost cloth or row cover</li>
    <li>Use supports to prevent fabric from touching leaves</li>
    <li>Water earlier in the day (moist soil retains more heat)</li>
    <li>Move container plants indoors if possible</li>
  </ul>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do After a Freeze</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Wait until plants fully thaw before assessing damage</li>
    <li>Do not prune immediately</li>
    <li>Check central growth for survival</li>
    <li>Delay fertilization for several days</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some seedlings recover if the growing point remains intact.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Will 32°F (0°C) kill all seedlings?</summary>
    <p>
      No. Cool-season crops may survive brief exposure, but warm-season seedlings are highly vulnerable.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is frost damage immediate?</summary>
    <p>
      Injury often appears after thawing, not during the freeze itself.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can seedlings recover from a light freeze?</summary>
    <p>
      If the central growing point survives, recovery is possible.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is 32°F always accurate in forecasts?</summary>
    <p>
      Garden-level temperatures can drop lower than forecast in calm conditions.
    </p>
