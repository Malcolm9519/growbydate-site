  <h1>How to Find Your Last Frost Date</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Your planting schedule starts with this one number.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    The average last frost date is the anchor for nearly every spring planting decision.
    Once you know it, you can calculate indoor seed start dates, transplant timing, and cold protection windows with confidence.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you already know your frost date, you can plug it into the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>
    to generate crop-specific start dates instantly.

  <h2>What Is a “Last Frost Date”?</h2>

  <p>
    Your <strong>average last frost date</strong> is the typical final spring freeze in your area.
    It’s calculated from historical weather data and represents the date when frost is unlikely — not impossible.
  </p>

  <p>
    A few important clarifications:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>It’s based on past averages, not a prediction for this year.</li>
    <li>Some years will have a later freeze.</li>
    <li>Microclimates can shift real-world conditions slightly.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Think of it as a planning anchor — not a guarantee.
  </p>

  <h2>How to Look Up Your Average Last Frost Date</h2>

  <p>
    You can find your frost date using:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>National weather databases</li>
    <li>Local extension office websites</li>
    <li>Reliable frost date calculators online</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Enter your ZIP code or nearest city, and you’ll see an estimated average last frost date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Write that date down — you’ll use it repeatedly throughout the season.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>USDA Zones vs. Frost Dates</h2>

  <p>
    USDA hardiness zones describe average winter minimum temperatures.
    They do <strong>not</strong> tell you your exact last frost date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two gardeners in the same zone can have different frost timing.
    Always check your specific location rather than relying on zone alone.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>How Accurate Is the Average?</h2>

  <p>
    Frost dates are usually presented at probability levels — for example, a 30% chance of frost after that date.
  </p>

  <p>
    This means:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Most years, frost will be finished by that date.</li>
    <li>Some years, a late frost can still occur.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you’re risk-averse, you can add a small buffer of 5–7 days.
    If you use protection (like row cover), you may be comfortable planting slightly earlier.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do After You Find It</h2>

  <p>
    Once you know your last frost date, you can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Count backward to determine indoor seed start timing</li>
    <li>Plan transplant dates for warm-season crops</li>
    <li>Schedule direct sowing for cool-season crops</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The simplest way to use your frost date is to enter it into the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
    It calculates start windows for common crops automatically.

  <h2>Short Growing Seasons: A Practical Note</h2>

  <p>
    In colder climates, your frost date often arrives later in spring.
    That shortens the growing window — but it doesn’t automatically mean starting seeds much earlier indoors.
  </p>

  <p>
    The transplant date drives success.
    The indoor start date supports it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using your actual frost date — instead of guessing — prevents leggy seedlings and timing stress.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>What if I can’t find an exact frost date for my town?</summary>
    <p>
      Use the nearest city with reliable weather data. Small differences are normal, and you can add a small buffer if needed.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I plant before my last frost date?</summary>
    <p>
      Cold-tolerant crops often can. Warm-season crops like tomatoes and peppers should wait until after frost risk has passed.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is my frost date the same every year?</summary>
    <p>
      No. It varies slightly each year. That’s why it’s listed as an average.
