      <h1>Seed Starting Schedule for Short Growing Seasons</h1>
      <p class="tagline">
        A clear method for planning indoor starts and transplant timing.
      </p>
      <p class="lede">
        In shorter climates, timing is the difference between a strong harvest and a rushed season.
        A written schedule removes guesswork and keeps your garden on track.

      <h2>Start With One Anchor Date</h2>

      <p>
        Every spring plan begins with your <strong>average last frost date</strong>.
        That date becomes the reference point for:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Indoor seed starting windows</li>
        <li>Hardening off periods</li>
        <li>Outdoor transplant timing</li>
        <li>Direct sow windows</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Instead of guessing when to plant, count backward (or forward) from that date.
      </p>

      <h2>The 3 Planning Windows That Matter</h2>

      <h3>1. Indoor Start Window</h3>
      <p>
        Most warm-season crops need a 6–10 week head start indoors in shorter climates.
        Count backward from your last frost date to determine when to sow.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Hardening Off Period</h3>
      <p>
        Plan 7–10 days before transplanting to gradually expose seedlings to
        wind, sun, and temperature changes.
        Skipping this step often delays growth after transplant.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Transplant or Direct Sow Window</h3>
      <p>
        Warm-season crops are usually transplanted 1–3 weeks after your last frost.
        Cool-season crops may be planted slightly before it.
      </p>

      <h2>Which Crops Should You Start Indoors?</h2>

      <p><strong>Usually started indoors (short-season advantage):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Peppers</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Kale</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Usually direct sown:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spinach</li>
        <li>Beans</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>
        <li>Radishes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In shorter seasons, giving warm crops a controlled indoor start
        significantly improves harvest reliability.
