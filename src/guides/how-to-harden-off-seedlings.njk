  <h1>How to Harden Off Seedlings</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    A simple 7-day schedule to prepare seedlings for transplanting.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    Seedlings grown indoors need time to adjust to outdoor conditions.
    Moving them outside too quickly can cause stress, leaf damage, or stalled growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Hardening off is the gradual process of exposing seedlings to sun, wind, and temperature changes before transplanting them into the garden.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Hardening Off Matters</h2>

  <p>
    Indoor seedlings grow in stable conditions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Consistent temperature</li>
    <li>No wind</li>
    <li>Filtered or artificial light</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Outdoor conditions are different. Direct sunlight is stronger. Wind dries soil quickly. Night temperatures fluctuate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without a transition period, seedlings may wilt, bleach, or stop growing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Proper timing also matters. Make sure your transplant date aligns with your local frost window using the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>When to Start Hardening Off</h2>

  <p>
    Begin hardening off about 7–10 days before your planned transplant date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transplant dates are usually based on your average last frost date.
    If you’re unsure of that date, see:
    <a href="/guides/how-to-find-your-last-frost-date/">How to Find Your Last Frost Date</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting too early can leave plants outside during unexpected cold snaps.
    Starting too late may delay growth.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>7-Day Hardening Off Schedule</h2>

  <p>
    Use this gradual approach to reduce transplant shock.
  </p>

  <h3>Day 1–2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Place seedlings outdoors in shade for 1–2 hours.</li>
    <li>Bring them back inside afterward.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Day 3–4</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Increase outdoor time to 3–4 hours.</li>
    <li>Allow brief exposure to morning sun.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Day 5–6</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Leave plants outside for most of the day.</li>
    <li>Gradually increase direct sunlight exposure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Day 7</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Leave seedlings outside full day and overnight if temperatures remain above safe levels for the crop.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    After this transition period, seedlings are ready for transplanting.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Watch the Weather</h2>

  <p>
    Avoid hardening off during:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Strong wind</li>
    <li>Heavy rain</li>
    <li>Unexpected frost warnings</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even after your average last frost date, short cold spells are possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    If frost is predicted, bring seedlings indoors or provide protection.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Signs Seedlings Are Not Ready</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Severe wilting after short sun exposure</li>
    <li>Bleached or white patches on leaves</li>
    <li>Stunted growth after exposure</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If this happens, reduce sun exposure and slow the schedule.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Hardening Off and Proper Seed Timing</h2>

  <p>
    Hardening off only works well when seedlings are started at the correct time.
  </p>

  <p>
    If seeds are started too early, plants may become root-bound or leggy before transplanting.
    See:
    <a href="/guides/starting-seeds-too-early/">What Happens If You Start Seeds Too Early?</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    For best results:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Calculate your start dates</li>
    <li>Plan your transplant date</li>
    <li>Begin hardening off 7–10 days before transplanting</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Start hardening off 7–10 days before transplanting.</li>
    <li>Increase outdoor exposure gradually.</li>
    <li>Watch for frost or strong weather.</li>
    <li>Match transplant timing to your last frost date.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Strong seedlings come from accurate timing and steady transition — not rushing the process.
