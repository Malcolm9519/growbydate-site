  <h1>32°F vs 28°F: What Temperature Actually Kills Plants?</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Not all freezes are equal — and not all plants respond the same way.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    Frost dates are calculated at <strong>32°F (0°C)</strong>, the freezing point of water.
    But plant damage depends on more than a single number. A brief dip to 32°F (0°C)
    may cause little harm, while a prolonged drop to <strong>28°F (-2°C)</strong>
    can severely damage tender crops. Understanding the difference helps you
    interpret your <a href="/tools/frost-date-finder/">frost dates</a>
    more accurately and plan with confidence.

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why 32°F (0°C) Is the Frost Threshold</h2>

  <p>
    The freezing point of water — 32°F (0°C) — is used in climate normals
    because ice formation can begin inside plant tissues at this temperature.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both NOAA (U.S.) and Environment and Climate Change Canada
    use this threshold when calculating average frost dates.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you look up your average last frost or first frost date,
    that date represents the historical midpoint (50% probability)
    of temperatures reaching <strong>32°F / 0°C</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a deeper explanation of that probability,
    see <a href="/guides/what-does-50-percent-frost-probability-mean/">what a 50% frost probability means</a>.

  <h2>Light Frost vs Hard Freeze</h2>

  <h3>Light Frost (Around 32°F / 0°C)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Surface ice may form.</li>
    <li>Leaf edges may show minor damage.</li>
    <li>Hardy crops often tolerate it.</li>
    <li>Duration matters — a short dip is less harmful.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hard Freeze (28°F / -2°C or Lower)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ice forms inside plant cells.</li>
    <li>Cell walls rupture.</li>
    <li>Tender plants often collapse within hours.</li>
    <li>Damage is usually irreversible.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The difference between 32°F (0°C) and 28°F (-2°C)
    may look small, but biologically it is significant.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Tender vs Hardy Crops</h2>

  <p>
    Plant type determines frost tolerance.
  </p>

  <h3>Tender (Frost-Sensitive)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Peppers</li>
    <li>Beans</li>
    <li>Cucumbers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These crops can suffer damage even at 32°F (0°C),
    especially when young.
  </p>

  <h3>Cool-Season (Light Frost Tolerant)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Broccoli</li>
    <li>Cabbage</li>
    <li>Kale</li>
    <li>Spinach</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Many cool-season crops tolerate brief exposure to 32°F (0°C)
    and sometimes slightly below.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seedlings are always more vulnerable than mature plants.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Duration Matters</h2>

  <p>
    Temperature alone doesn’t determine damage.
    The length of exposure plays a major role.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>30 minutes at 32°F (0°C) may cause minimal harm.</li>
    <li>Several hours below 30°F (-1°C) increases injury risk.</li>
    <li>Sustained 28°F (-2°C) or lower can kill tender plants.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Calm, clear nights often produce colder surface temperatures
    than reported air temperature at weather stations.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>How This Affects Spring Planting</h2>

  <p>
    Your average last frost date marks the 50% chance
    of reaching 32°F (0°C).
  </p>

  <p>
    That does not mean:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>No freeze will occur afterward.</li>
    <li>All plants are safe at that temperature.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For warm-season crops, waiting until nighttime temperatures
    remain consistently above 50°F (10°C)
    is often safer than focusing only on the frost date.

<section class="card">
  <h2>How This Affects Fall Harvest</h2>

  <p>
    In autumn, a light frost around 32°F (0°C)
    may only damage tender leaves.
  </p>

  <p>
    A hard freeze below 28°F (-2°C)
    usually ends the season for warm crops.
  </p>

    To estimate fall cutoffs based on your average first frost date,
    use the <a href="/tools/first-frost-planner/">fall planting planner</a>.

<section class="card">
  <h2>Protection: What It Can and Can’t Do</h2>

  <p>
    Frost cloth, row cover, or tunnels can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Buffer a few degrees.</li>
    <li>Reduce radiational cooling.</li>
    <li>Protect against light frost.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    They cannot protect plants through a prolonged hard freeze.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use protection to reduce risk —
    not to override temperature reality.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Is 32°F (0°C) always damaging?</summary>
    <p>
      Not always. Damage depends on crop type,
      growth stage, and how long temperatures stay at or below freezing.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What temperature kills tomatoes?</summary>
    <p>
      Tomatoes are frost-sensitive and may be damaged at 32°F (0°C).
      Prolonged exposure below 30°F (-1°C) often causes severe injury.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can plants survive 28°F (-2°C)?</summary>
    <p>
      Hardy crops sometimes can.
      Tender crops usually cannot, especially if exposure lasts several hours.
    </p>
