  <h1>What Does a 50% Frost Probability Mean?</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Frost dates are risk markers — not guarantees.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    When you look up your average last frost date using the
    <a href="/tools/frost-date-finder/">frost date finder</a>,
    the date shown is typically based on a <strong>50% probability</strong> at the
    <strong>32°F (0°C)</strong> freeze threshold.
    That number represents statistical risk — not certainty.
  </p>

  <h2>What 50% Probability Actually Means</h2>

  <p>
    A 50% frost probability means that, based on historical climate normals,
    there was a 50% chance temperatures reached 32°F (0°C) on or before that date.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Half of the recorded years were earlier.</li>
    <li>Half were later.</li>
    <li>It represents the statistical midpoint.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It does <strong>not</strong> mean frost will happen exactly on that day,
    nor does it mean frost will not occur after that day.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Climate Normals Use 50%</h2>

  <p>
    Frost dates are calculated from 30-year climate normals
    (1991–2020 in the U.S. and Canada).
  </p>

  <p>
    The 50% threshold provides:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A stable planning anchor</li>
    <li>A balanced midpoint between early and late risk</li>
    <li>A consistent standard across regions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is useful for planning — but not a guarantee of safety.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What Frost Dates Represent (And What They Don’t)</h2>

  <p>
    Your average last frost date represents the historical midpoint
    for freezing at 32°F (0°C).
  </p>

  <p>
    It does not represent:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>The earliest frost ever recorded</li>
    <li>A guaranteed frost-free day</li>
    <li>Your exact yard’s microclimate</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Frost dates reduce guesswork — they do not eliminate risk.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Frost Dates Vary Year to Year</h2>

  <p>
    Even in stable climates, freeze timing shifts because of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Late cold fronts</li>
    <li>Clear, calm nights that allow rapid cooling</li>
    <li>Snow cover patterns</li>
    <li>Cloud cover differences</li>
    <li>Soil moisture levels</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some years will warm early and stay mild.
    Others will see freezing return after a warm stretch.
    This variability is normal and built into the 50% probability.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Planning Conservatively vs Aggressively</h2>

  <h3>More Conservative Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Plant warm-season crops after the average frost date.</li>
    <li>Use the later end of transplant windows.</li>
    <li>Wait for steady nighttime lows above freezing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>More Aggressive Approach</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Plant near the average frost date.</li>
    <li>Use row cover for light frost risk.</li>
    <li>Accept some chance of replanting.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The right approach depends on your climate stability and risk tolerance.

  <h2>Why 32°F (0°C) Matters</h2>

  <p>
    The frost dates shown in the
    <a href="/tools/frost-date-finder/">frost date finder</a>
    use the <strong>32°F (0°C)</strong> freeze threshold.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this temperature:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Water in plant tissue can begin to freeze.</li>
    <li>Tender seedlings may suffer damage.</li>
    <li>Duration of cold becomes important.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Brief dips near freezing may cause minor damage.
    Prolonged freezes cause greater harm.

  <h2>Using Frost Probability for Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Your last frost date anchors your indoor start schedule.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Find your average last frost date.</li>
    <li>Count backward the recommended number of weeks.</li>
    <li>Adjust based on soil temperature and nighttime lows.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    If you prefer automatic calculation, use the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">seed starting planner</a>
    to generate crop-specific windows.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Using Frost Probability for Fall Planning</h2>

  <p>
    The same probability logic applies to first frost.
  </p>

  <p>
    Count backward from your average first frost date
    and allow extra time for slower fall growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a href="/tools/first-frost-planner/">fall planting planner</a>
    converts your frost date into practical deadlines.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Is a 50% frost date safe?</summary>
    <p>
      No. It represents the midpoint of historical freeze timing, not a guarantee.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why not use hardiness zones?</summary>
    <p>
      Hardiness zones describe winter minimum temperatures, not spring freeze timing.
      Frost dates are more useful for planting schedules.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does this apply in Canada?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Frost probability and 32°F (0°C) freeze thresholds apply across cold regions
      in both the U.S. and Canada.
    </p>
