  <h1>How Frost Dates and Growing Degree Days Work Together</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Frost defines the boundary. Heat determines the outcome.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    In a typical year, your growing season is constrained by frost risk at <strong>32°F (0°C)</strong>.
    But season length alone does not determine whether a crop will mature.
    Growing Degree Days (GDD) measure the heat accumulation that drives development inside that frost window.
  </p>

  <h2>Frost Dates Define the Seasonal Boundary</h2>

  <p>
    Frost timing is the outer limit of crop planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    GrowByDate uses 1991–2020 climate normals and frames frost dates at the <strong>50% probability level</strong>.
    That means in a typical year, there is historically a 50% chance of frost occurring on or after your last spring frost date,
    and a 50% chance of frost occurring on or before your first fall frost date.
  </p>

  <p>
    These dates use the 32°F threshold because most frost-sensitive crops are damaged at or near that temperature.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can identify your local frost boundaries using the
    <a href="/tools/frost-date-finder/">Frost Date Finder</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The time between those two dates defines your frost-free growing window.
  </p>

  <h2>Season Length Is Not the Same as Heat Availability</h2>

  <p>
    A 120-day frost-free season does not automatically provide 120 days of optimal growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    In cooler climates, early summer nights may remain in the 40s and low 50s.
    Late summer cooling can slow plant metabolism before first frost risk returns.
  </p>

  <p>
    The calendar window is open — but temperature accumulation may be limited.
  </p>

  <p>
    This distinction matters most in short growing seasons, where development speed determines whether fruit ripens before first frost.
  </p>

  <h2>What Growing Degree Days Measure</h2>

  <p>
    Growing Degree Days measure accumulated heat over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most warm-season vegetables use a base temperature of <strong>50°F (10°C)</strong>.
    Below that base, meaningful development slows dramatically.
  </p>

  <pre>
GDD = ((Daily High + Daily Low) ÷ 2) − Base Temperature
  </pre>

  <p>
    Each day contributes heat units.
    Over the course of a season, those units accumulate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crops require a certain total GDD range to mature.
    The key planning question becomes:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>How many heat units typically accumulate between your last and first frost?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can model that using the
    <a href="/tools/growing-degree-day-planner/">Growing Degree Day Planner</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Same Frost Window, Different Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    Consider two locations with the same 120-day frost-free window at the 50% probability level.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location A:</strong> ~1,800 GDD (base 50)</li>
    <li><strong>Location B:</strong> ~2,600 GDD (base 50)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The season length appears identical.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the thermal accumulation is not.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the lower-GDD climate, long-season tomatoes or winter squash may not fully mature before first frost.
    In the higher-GDD climate, those same varieties may finish comfortably.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frost determines how long the clock runs.
    GDD determines how much development happens while it runs.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Using Frost and GDD as One Planning System</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Identify your 50% frost dates</strong> using the 32°F definition.</li>
    <li><strong>Calculate your frost-free window length.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Estimate total GDD accumulation inside that window.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Compare that total to crop heat requirements.</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This creates a deterministic planning model:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Frost → Season Length → GDD → Crop Maturity</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    If your expected GDD total is close to a crop’s requirement, maturity risk increases in a typical year.
    If your total comfortably exceeds it, your margin is larger.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why This Matters in Short Growing Seasons</h2>

  <p>
    In northern climates, higher elevations, and many inland regions, the limiting factor is often not just frost timing —
    but total heat accumulation before frost returns.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may technically have enough frost-free days,
    yet still lack the thermal accumulation required for late-season varieties.
  </p>

  <p>
    Modeling both frost probability and GDD totals allows you to make crop decisions based on climate normals rather than calendar assumptions.

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Frost dates use a 32°F definition and are framed at 50% probability.</li>
    <li>Frost defines your seasonal boundary.</li>
    <li>Growing Degree Days measure accumulated heat inside that boundary.</li>
    <li>Short growing seasons often diverge between calendar length and thermal capacity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When frost timing and heat accumulation are used together, crop maturity planning becomes climate-based rather than calendar-based.
