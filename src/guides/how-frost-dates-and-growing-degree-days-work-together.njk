  <h1>How Frost Dates and Growing Degree Days Work Together</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Frost sets the boundary. Heat determines the outcome.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Frost dates tell you how long your growing season is. Growing Degree Days (GDD) tell you how much development can happen inside it.</strong>
    In short growing seasons, those are not the same thing — and understanding the difference is essential for maturity planning.
  </p>

  <h2>Frost Dates Define the Season Boundary</h2>

  <p>
    In climate-based planning, frost defines the outer limits of your season.
  </p>

  <p>
    GrowByDate uses the standard <strong>32°F (0°C)</strong> frost threshold and frames dates using 1991–2020 climate normals. Most frost dates are expressed at the <strong>50% probability level</strong>, meaning that in a typical year there is roughly a 50% chance of frost occurring on or after that spring date, or on or before that fall date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your last spring frost marks the typical beginning of frost-sensitive planting. Your first fall frost marks the typical end.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can find both boundaries using the
    <a href="/tools/frost-date-finder/">Frost Date Finder</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Those two dates create your frost-free window — often described as your growing season length.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>But Frost-Free Does Not Mean Warm</h2>

  <p>
    A common assumption is that if you have 120 frost-free days, you automatically have enough time for a 100-day crop.
  </p>

  <p>
    In warmer climates, that may often be true.
  </p>

  <p>
    In cooler climates, it often is not.
  </p>

  <p>
    Early summer nights in the 40s and low 50s slow plant metabolism. Late summer cooling reduces development speed before frost risk returns. Even though the calendar window is open, temperature accumulation may be limited.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is why frost dates alone are not enough for reliable maturity modeling.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What Growing Degree Days Actually Measure</h2>

  <p>
    Growing Degree Days (GDD) measure accumulated heat — the thermal energy crops use to progress from vegetative growth to flowering and fruit maturity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most warm-season vegetables use a base temperature of <strong>50°F (10°C)</strong>. Below that threshold, growth slows dramatically.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Simplified daily formula:</strong></p>

  <pre>
GDD = ((Daily High + Daily Low) ÷ 2) − Base Temperature
  </pre>

  <p>
    Each day contributes heat units. Over a season, those units accumulate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crops require a certain total GDD range to mature. The key question becomes:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>How many heat units typically accumulate between your last and first frost?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can estimate that using the
    <a href="/tools/growing-degree-day-planner/">Growing Degree Day Planner</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Same Frost Window, Different Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    Consider two locations with the same frost-free length in a typical year — about 120 days between the 50% last frost and 50% first frost.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location A</strong> accumulates ~1,800 GDD (base 50).</li>
    <li><strong>Location B</strong> accumulates ~2,600 GDD (base 50).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The calendar looks identical.
  </p>

  <p>
    The maturity outcomes are not.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the lower-GDD climate, long-season crops may still be green when first frost (32°F) arrives. In the higher-GDD climate, those same crops may finish comfortably.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frost defines how long the clock runs. GDD determines how fast the crop develops while the clock is running.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Where 50% Probability Fits In</h2>

  <p>
    Because frost dates are probability-based, your growing season is not a fixed guarantee.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Some years your last frost is earlier.</li>
    <li>Some years it is later.</li>
    <li>Some years first frost arrives early.</li>
    <li>Some years it arrives late.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When you calculate available GDD between your typical frost boundaries, you are modeling a <strong>typical year</strong> — not predicting an exact outcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Risk tolerance matters. If your crop’s GDD requirement nearly equals your typical seasonal total, your margin for variation is smaller.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>How Frost and GDD Work as One System</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Find your frost boundaries</strong> using the 32°F definition.</li>
    <li><strong>Calculate your frost-free window length.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Estimate total GDD accumulation inside that window.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Compare that total to your crop’s heat requirement.</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    That chain — Frost → Season Length → GDD → Maturity — is the core planning model behind GrowByDate.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you need additional buffer, starting seeds earlier indoors may help, provided it meaningfully shifts transplant timing relative to frost risk. The key is anchoring all decisions to your frost boundaries and expected heat accumulation.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why This Matters Most in Short Growing Seasons</h2>

  <p>
    In northern climates, high elevations, and many inland regions, the growing season is constrained not just by frost timing — but by slower heat accumulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may have enough calendar days, but not enough GDD for long-season varieties.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why climate-based crop planning requires both metrics:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frost dates</strong> define the boundary.</li>
    <li><strong>Growing Degree Days</strong> define the development capacity inside that boundary.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Frost uses a 32°F (0°C) definition and is typically expressed at 50% probability.</li>
    <li>Frost-free days measure calendar length.</li>
    <li>GDD measures accumulated heat.</li>
    <li>Short growing seasons often have limited heat accumulation even when frost-free windows look adequate.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When you evaluate crops using both frost timing and Growing Degree Days, you move from general planting advice to climate-based maturity modeling.
  </p>

  <p>
    That shift — from calendar gardening to thermal planning — is what makes short-season success more predictable in a typical year.
