    <h1>How Frost Dates and Growing Degree Days Work Together</h1>
    <p class="lede">
      Frost defines the boundaries of your growing season. Growing Degree Days determine what can actually mature inside it. Together, they form the foundation of climate-based crop timing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    In a typical year, your growing season is defined by frost.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using the standard 32°F (0°C) threshold, your <strong>last spring frost</strong> marks the beginning of frost-sensitive planting, and your <strong>first fall frost</strong> marks the end of that window. These dates are calculated using long-term climate normals (1991–2020) and are typically expressed at the 50% probability level — meaning there is historically a 50% chance of frost occurring on or after that spring date, or on or before that fall date.
  </p>

  <p>
    But frost-free days alone do not determine whether a crop will mature.
  </p>

  <p>
    Temperature accumulation does.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two gardeners can both have 120 frost-free days and still experience very different outcomes — because what happens between those dates matters just as much as the dates themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where Growing Degree Days (GDD) enter the system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frost defines the boundary of the season. Growing Degree Days determine how much development happens inside it.
  </p>

  <h2>Frost Dates Define Your Growing Season Length</h2>

  <p>
    If you’ve used the <a href="/tools/frost-date-finder/">Frost Date Finder</a>, you’ve already identified:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your typical last spring frost (32°F threshold)</li>
    <li>Your typical first fall frost (32°F threshold)</li>
    <li>Your estimated frost-free season length</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For example:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Last frost: May 20</li>
    <li>First frost: September 20</li>
    <li>Frost-free season: ~123 days</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In calendar terms, that appears to be enough time for many crops.
  </p>

  <p>
    But frost-free does not mean warm.
  </p>

  <p>
    In cooler climates, early summer and late summer temperatures may be mild. Nighttime lows can remain in the 40s or low 50s well into June. Those temperatures slow plant development — even though frost is no longer occurring.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why frost dates are necessary — but not sufficient — for maturity planning.
  </p>

  <h2>What Growing Degree Days Measure</h2>

  <p>
    Growing Degree Days (GDD) measure accumulated heat over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most warm-season crops use a base temperature of 50°F. Below that threshold, meaningful growth slows dramatically.
  </p>

  <p>
    A simplified daily formula looks like this:
  </p>

  <pre>
GDD = ((Daily High + Daily Low) ÷ 2) − Base Temperature
  </pre>

  <p>
    If the average daily temperature is 60°F:
  </p>

  <p>
    ((60 + 50) ÷ 2) − 50 = 5 GDD
  </p>

  <p>
    If the average is 75°F:
  </p>

  <p>
    ((85 + 65) ÷ 2) − 50 = 25 GDD
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, these heat units accumulate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crops require a certain total GDD range to reach maturity. So while frost dates define how long your season is, GDD defines how productive that season is.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Frost-Free Days and GDD Are Not the Same</h2>

  <p>
    Consider two locations that both have 120 frost-free days based on the 32°F threshold.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Location A (Cool Climate):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mild days, cool nights</li>
    <li>Accumulates ~1,800 GDD (base 50)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Location B (Warmer Climate):</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Warmer days and nights</li>
    <li>Accumulates ~2,600 GDD (base 50)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    On paper, the season length is identical.
  </p>

  <p>
    In reality, the heat accumulation is dramatically different.
  </p>

  <p>
    That difference determines whether a late tomato variety matures, sweet corn reaches full development, or winter squash hardens before first frost.
  </p>

  <h2>The Role of 50% Probability Frost Dates</h2>

  <p>
    Frost dates are not exact deadlines.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the 50% probability level:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>There is historically a 50% chance of frost on or after your last frost date.</li>
    <li>There is historically a 50% chance of frost on or before your first frost date.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In some years, your season will be slightly longer. In others, it will be shorter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Growing Degree Day modeling works within this probability framework. When you calculate available GDD between your average last and first frost dates, you are modeling a typical year — not a guaranteed one.
  </p>

  <h2>How Frost and GDD Work Together in Practice</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Identify Your Frost Window</strong><br>
      Use the <a href="/tools/frost-date-finder/">Frost Date Finder</a> to determine your typical frost-free season using the 32°F definition.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Estimate Your Available Heat Units</strong><br>
      Use the <a href="/tools/growing-degree-day-planner/">Growing Degree Day Planner</a> to estimate how many GDD typically accumulate within that window.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Compare Crop Requirements</strong><br>
      If your available GDD is lower than the crop’s requirement, maturity before first frost becomes unlikely in a typical year.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Frost provides the calendar boundary. GDD provides the thermal reality.
  </p>

  <h2>Why This Matters in Short Growing Seasons</h2>

  <p>
    In northern climates, high elevations, or coastal regions, the growing season is often constrained not just by frost timing — but by slower heat accumulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may have 110–120 frost-free days, but only 1,700–2,000 GDD (base 50).
  </p>

  <p>
    That may be sufficient for bush beans or zucchini — but marginal for long-season tomatoes, large pumpkins, or late corn varieties.
  </p>

  <p>
    The frost date tells you when the clock starts and stops. The GDD total tells you whether the crop can finish before the clock runs out.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Thought</h2>

  <p>
    Frost defines the boundaries of your season.
  </p>

  <p>
    Growing Degree Days determine what happens inside it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Used separately, each provides partial insight. Used together, they create a complete climate-based crop timing system.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before choosing a crop or variety, model both your frost window and your expected heat accumulation. Climate timing — not calendar dates — determines maturity success in a typical year.
