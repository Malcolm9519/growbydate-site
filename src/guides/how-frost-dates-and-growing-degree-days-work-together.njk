  <h1>How Frost Dates and Growing Degree Days Work Together</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    Frost defines the boundary. Heat determines the outcome.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    In a typical year, your growing season is constrained by frost risk at <strong>32°F (0°C)</strong>.
    But season length alone does not determine whether a crop will mature.
    Growing Degree Days (GDD) measure the heat accumulation that drives development inside that frost window.
  </p>

  <h2>Frost Dates Define the Seasonal Boundary</h2>

  <p>
    Frost timing is the outer limit of crop planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    GrowByDate uses 1991–2020 climate normals and frames frost dates at the <strong>50% probability level</strong>.
    That means there is historically a 50% chance of frost occurring on or after your last spring frost date,
    and a 50% chance of frost occurring on or before your first fall frost date.
  </p>

  <p>
    These dates use the 32°F threshold because most frost-sensitive crops are damaged at or near that temperature.
    If you want a deeper explanation of that cutoff, see
    <a href="/guides/what-happens-to-seedlings-at-32-degrees/">What Happens to Seedlings at 32 Degrees?</a>
    and
    <a href="/guides/light-freeze-vs-hard-freeze/">Light Freeze vs Hard Freeze</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can identify your typical frost boundaries using the
    <a href="/tools/frost-date-finder/">Frost Date Finder</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The time between those two dates defines your frost-free growing window —
    but it does not automatically define your heat availability.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Season Length Is Not the Same as Heat Accumulation</h2>

  <p>
    A 120-day frost-free season does not guarantee that a 100-day crop will mature.
  </p>

  <p>
    As explained in
    <a href="/guides/average-frost-date-vs-actual-weather/">Average Frost Date vs Actual Weather</a>,
    climate normals describe what typically happens — not what happens every year.
    The same principle applies to heat accumulation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In cooler climates, early summer nights in the 40s and low 50s slow plant metabolism.
    Late summer cooling reduces development speed before first frost risk returns.
  </p>

  <p>
    The calendar window is open — but thermal progress may be slower than expected.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What Growing Degree Days Measure</h2>

  <p>
    Growing Degree Days measure accumulated heat over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most warm-season vegetables use a base temperature of <strong>50°F (10°C)</strong>.
    Below that base, meaningful growth slows dramatically.
  </p>

  <pre>
GDD = ((Daily High + Daily Low) ÷ 2) − Base Temperature
  </pre>

  <p>
    Each day contributes heat units. Over a season, those units accumulate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crops require a certain total GDD range to mature.
    The key planning question becomes:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>How many heat units typically accumulate between your last and first frost?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    You can model that using the
    <a href="/tools/growing-degree-day-planner/">Growing Degree Day Planner</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Same Frost Window, Different Maturity Outcomes</h2>

  <p>
    Consider two locations with the same 120-day frost-free window at the 50% probability level.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location A:</strong> ~1,800 GDD (base 50)</li>
    <li><strong>Location B:</strong> ~2,600 GDD (base 50)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The season length appears identical.
  </p>

  <p>
    The maturity outcomes are not.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the lower-GDD climate, long-season tomatoes or winter squash may not fully mature before first frost.
    In the higher-GDD climate, those same varieties may finish comfortably.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is why relying only on “days to maturity” can be misleading —
    especially in cold climates. (We’ll explore that in more depth in the next guide in this series.)
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Using Frost and GDD as One Planning System</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Identify your 50% frost dates</strong> using the 32°F definition.</li>
    <li><strong>Calculate your frost-free window length.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Estimate total GDD accumulation inside that window.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Compare that total to crop heat requirements.</strong></li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    This creates a deterministic planning chain:
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Frost → Season Length → GDD → Crop Maturity</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    If your expected GDD total is close to a crop’s requirement,
    maturity risk increases in a typical year.
    If your total comfortably exceeds it, your buffer is larger.
  </p>

  <p>
    When planning transplant timing relative to frost risk,
    you can anchor indoor starts using the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Start Planner</a>
    so that maturity modeling aligns with your frost boundary.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why This Matters Most in Short Growing Seasons</h2>

  <p>
    In northern climates, higher elevations, and many inland regions,
    the limiting factor is often not just frost timing —
    but total heat accumulation before frost returns.
  </p>

  <p>
    As discussed in
    <a href="/guides/why-frost-dates-matter-more-than-planting-calendars/">Why Frost Dates Matter More Than Planting Calendars</a>,
    climate-based timing is more reliable than fixed calendar dates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adding GDD modeling to frost timing completes the system.
    You are no longer asking “When can I plant?”
    You are asking “Will this crop mature before first frost in a typical year?”
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Frost dates use a 32°F definition and are framed at 50% probability.</li>
    <li>Frost defines your seasonal boundary.</li>
    <li>Growing Degree Days measure accumulated heat inside that boundary.</li>
    <li>Short growing seasons often diverge between calendar length and thermal capacity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When frost timing and heat accumulation are used together,
    crop maturity planning becomes climate-based rather than calendar-based.
  </p>

  <p>
    That integration — frost boundaries plus GDD totals —
    is the foundation of GrowByDate’s climate intelligence model.
