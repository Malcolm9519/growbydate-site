  <h1>When to Pot Up Seedlings (And When Not To)</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Bigger containers help — but only at the right time.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Pot up seedlings when roots begin to fill their original cells — not simply because the plants look tall.</strong>
    Transplanting into larger containers too early can slow growth, while waiting too long can cause root restriction.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before extending indoor time with larger containers, confirm your transplant schedule using the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
    Potting up should support outdoor timing — not replace it.

<section class="card">
  <h2>What “Potting Up” Means</h2>

  <p>
    Potting up is the process of moving seedlings from small starter cells into larger containers before outdoor transplant.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is common when:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Seedlings outgrow their cells</li>
    <li>Transplant timing is still weeks away</li>
    <li>Roots begin circling at the bottom</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It is not required for every crop.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Signs Seedlings Are Ready for Larger Containers</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Roots visible through drainage holes</li>
    <li>Soil drying out unusually fast</li>
    <li>Noticeable root circling when removed from the tray</li>
    <li>Stalled growth despite proper light and feeding</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Seedlings that remain too long in small cells can become root-bound,
    reducing vigor at transplant.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>When Potting Up Is Not Necessary</h2>

  <p>
    If outdoor transplant is only one to two weeks away,
    potting up may add stress without benefit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Short indoor durations often eliminate the need for larger containers.
    This is one reason correct start timing matters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting too early frequently creates unnecessary potting cycles.
    If you’ve begun ahead of schedule, our guide on
    <a href="/guides/starting-seeds-too-early/">starting seeds too early</a>
    explains recovery options.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Warm-Season vs Cool-Season Crops</h2>

  <p>
    Warm-season crops such as tomatoes and peppers are more likely to require potting up,
    especially in short growing seasons where transplant timing may be delayed by cold soil.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool-season crops like lettuce and broccoli are often transplanted while still small
    and may not need additional container space.
  </p>

  <p>
    Extended indoor time increases the likelihood of needing larger containers.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Choosing the Next Container Size</h2>

  <p>
    Move up gradually rather than jumping to very large pots.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moderate increases in volume encourage steady root expansion without
    holding excess moisture around young roots.
  </p>

  <p>
    Using appropriate container size is covered in more detail in our guide on
    <a href="/guides/best-containers-for-starting-seeds-indoors/">seed starting containers</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil and Fertility During Potting Up</h2>

  <p>
    Once seedlings move into larger containers,
    a slightly richer potting mix may be appropriate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Light feeding can begin after true leaves are established.
    Overfertilizing indoors remains a common mistake.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Short-Season Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    In colder northern regions across the U.S. and comparable Canadian climates,
    late spring cold snaps can delay transplanting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Potting up may be helpful when:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Soil temperatures remain below safe transplant levels</li>
    <li>Frost risk lingers beyond the average date</li>
    <li>Seedlings are healthy but outdoor conditions are not ready</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    However, repeated potting up is often a sign that initial seed timing was too early.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>How many times can I pot up seedlings?</summary>
    <p>
      Most crops only need one size increase before transplant.
      Multiple pot-ups usually indicate early sowing.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I plant root-bound seedlings directly outdoors?</summary>
    <p>
      Lightly loosen circling roots before transplant to improve establishment.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does potting up make plants stronger?</summary>
    <p>
      Only if roots truly need more space. Otherwise, it can slow growth.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does this advice apply in both the U.S. and Canada?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Root growth depends on container size and timing, not geography.
    </p>
