  <h1>Should You Wait 2 Weeks After Frost to Plant Tomatoes?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    The “2-week rule” is a buffer — not a law.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Waiting 1–2 weeks after your average last frost date is often safer for tomatoes — but temperature matters more than the calendar.</strong>
    Tomatoes prefer nighttime lows above 50°F (10°C), and cold soil can delay growth even after frost risk declines.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>You do not always need to wait exactly two weeks after frost — but many gardeners benefit from a short buffer.</strong>
    The real goal is to avoid:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Late freeze events</li>
    <li>Repeated nights below 50°F (10°C)</li>
    <li>Cold soil temperatures under 60°F (16°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If those risks are still present, waiting improves transplant success.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why the 2-Week Rule Exists</h2>

  <p>
    The average last frost date reflects probability.
    A late frost can still occur after that date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Waiting two weeks provides a safety buffer during unstable spring weather —
    especially in colder climates across northern regions of the U.S. and comparable Canadian growing areas.

<section class="card">
  <h2>Tomatoes Care About Night Temperatures</h2>

  <p>
    Even if frost risk has passed, tomatoes are sensitive to cool nights.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>50°F (10°C):</strong> growth slows</li>
    <li><strong>45°F (7°C):</strong> noticeable delay</li>
    <li><strong>40°F (4°C):</strong> stress likely</li>
    <li><strong>32°F (0°C):</strong> freeze damage risk</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A transplant that survives but stalls loses valuable growing time.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>When You Should Wait</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Nighttime lows are still below 50°F (10°C)</li>
    <li>The forecast shows additional cold snaps</li>
    <li>Soil temperatures remain cool</li>
    <li>Your growing season is short and delays matter</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short-season regions, even a small setback can reduce total yield.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>When You May Not Need to Wait</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>No frost is forecast</li>
    <li>Nighttime lows consistently exceed 50°F (10°C)</li>
    <li>Soil has warmed above 60°F (16°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In stable warming patterns, planting soon after the last frost date can be reasonable.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do If You Planted Early</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Monitor the 7-day forecast</li>
    <li>Cover plants if temperatures approach 40°F (4°C)</li>
    <li>Protect aggressively if frost is forecast</li>
    <li>Avoid fertilizing during cold stress</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Tomatoes can recover from minor cold exposure,
    but prevention is easier than correction.

  <h2>Calendar vs. Conditions</h2>

  <p>
    The most reliable method is not “two weeks.”
    It is monitoring nighttime lows and soil temperature trends.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frost dates reduce risk.
    Temperature stability determines success.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Do I have to wait exactly two weeks?</summary>
    <p>
      No. It’s a buffer guideline, not a strict rule.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is it risky to plant immediately after the last frost?</summary>
    <p>
      It can be if cold nights continue or another frost occurs.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What temperature is truly safe for tomatoes?</summary>
    <p>
      Nighttime lows consistently above 50°F (10°C) are safer for strong growth.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does this apply in both U.S. and Canadian climates?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Frost timing varies by location, but temperature thresholds remain consistent in comparable cold regions.
