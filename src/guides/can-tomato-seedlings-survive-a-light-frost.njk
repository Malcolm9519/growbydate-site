  <h1>Can Tomato Seedlings Survive a Light Frost?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Light frost is still freezing — and tomatoes are tender.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Tomato seedlings are vulnerable during a light frost.</strong>
    Even a brief dip to 32°F (0°C) can damage leaves, and temperatures below that increase the risk of plant death.
    Survival depends on duration, exposure, and whether the growing point freezes.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Tomato seedlings may survive a very brief light frost, but damage is common.</strong>
    A light frost typically occurs at 32°F (0°C) under calm, clear conditions.
    Leaf injury is likely, especially if exposure lasts more than a short period.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the central growing point remains alive, recovery is possible.
    If stems freeze solid, the plant may not survive.

  <h2>What “Light Frost” Actually Means</h2>

  <p>
    A light frost usually occurs when:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Air temperature reaches 32°F (0°C)</li>
    <li>Skies are clear</li>
    <li>Winds are calm</li>
    <li>Heat escapes quickly from soil and foliage</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even if the forecast says 33–34°F (1°C),
    ground-level temperatures may briefly dip to freezing in low spots.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>How Tomatoes Respond to a Light Frost</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Leaves turn dark or water-soaked after thawing</li>
    <li>Foliage collapses and becomes limp</li>
    <li>Growth stalls for several days</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If the freeze is brief, roots often remain alive.
    The growing tip determines whether the plant can recover.
  </p>

  <h2>Temperature Thresholds for Tomatoes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Above 50°F (10°C):</strong> active growth</li>
    <li><strong>45°F (7°C):</strong> slowdown</li>
    <li><strong>40°F (4°C):</strong> stress likely</li>
    <li><strong>32°F (0°C):</strong> freeze injury possible</li>
    <li><strong>Below 30°F (-1°C):</strong> severe damage likely</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The colder and longer the exposure, the greater the injury.

  <h2>What to Do Before a Light Frost</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cover plants before sunset with frost cloth or row cover</li>
    <li>Use supports to prevent fabric from touching leaves</li>
    <li>Water soil earlier in the day to retain warmth</li>
    <li>Move containers indoors if possible</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Remove covers after temperatures rise above freezing.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do After a Light Frost</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Wait until plants fully thaw before assessing damage</li>
    <li>Do not prune immediately</li>
    <li>Check for green, firm growth at the center</li>
    <li>Delay fertilizer for several days</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some seedlings recover fully if the growing tip remains intact.

  <h2>Why Light Frost Happens After the “Last Frost Date”</h2>

  <p>
    The average last frost date reflects probability, not certainty.
    Late-season light frost events are still possible.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Will one light frost kill tomato seedlings?</summary>
    <p>
      It may damage leaves, but survival depends on whether the growing point freezes.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can tomatoes recover after frost damage?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes, if the main stem and central growth remain alive.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is 33°F (1°C) safe for tomatoes?</summary>
    <p>
      It may still allow frost formation at plant level under calm conditions.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I replant after a light frost?</summary>
    <p>
      Wait a few days before deciding. New growth indicates recovery.
    </p>
