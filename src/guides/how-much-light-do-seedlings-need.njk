  <h1>How Much Light Do Seedlings Actually Need?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Duration and intensity both matter.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Most vegetable seedlings require 12–16 hours of bright light per day after germination.</strong>
    Light must be close and consistent. Weak or distant light leads to thin, stretched growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before adjusting lighting duration, confirm your indoor start timing with the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>
    so seedlings are not spending unnecessary extra weeks indoors.
  </p>
</header>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Light Duration vs Light Intensity</h2>

  <p>
    Seedlings respond to both how long light is available and how strong it is.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 12–16 hours daily</li>
    <li><strong>Dark period:</strong> 8–12 hours of uninterrupted darkness</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Extending light beyond 16 hours rarely improves quality and can stress plants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Intensity is often the limiting factor indoors. Light must be close enough to prevent stretching.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What “Bright” Means Indoors</h2>

  <p>
    A bright room is not the same as bright light at plant level.
  </p>

  <p>
    South-facing windows provide the strongest natural light, but winter sun angles reduce intensity.
  </p>

  <p>
    For many gardeners starting seeds in late winter:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Natural light may be insufficient.</li>
    <li>Indirect light is rarely enough.</li>
    <li>Cloudy climates reduce intensity further.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Supplemental lighting often improves consistency.
  </p>

  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Distance From the Light Source</h2>

  <p>
    Light intensity drops quickly with distance.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Position lights 1–3 inches above seedlings.</li>
    <li>Adjust height as plants grow.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Distant light causes elongation, even if duration is correct.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Warm-Season Crops Need More Consistency</h2>

  <p>
    Tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant remain indoors for 6–10 weeks.
    That extended period increases light demands.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool-season crops often transplant earlier and are slightly more tolerant of moderate light.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Signs Light Is Insufficient</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Thin stems</li>
    <li>Excessive height</li>
    <li>Pale leaves</li>
    <li>Leaning toward windows</li>
  </ul>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Short-Season Implications</h2>

  <p>
    In colder northern regions across the U.S. and comparable Canadian climates, seeds are often started in late winter.
  </p>

  <p>
    During that period:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Daylight hours are shorter.</li>
    <li>Sun angle is lower.</li>
    <li>Cloud cover may be frequent.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Earlier starts increase the likelihood that supplemental lighting is necessary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Adjusting start timing can reduce reliance on equipment.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Practical Light Setup Guidelines</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Use 12–16 hours of light daily.</li>
    <li>Keep lights close to seedlings.</li>
    <li>Lower temperatures slightly after germination.</li>
    <li>Start seeds according to transplant timing — not calendar impatience.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Proper timing reduces extended exposure to indoor limitations.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can seedlings get too much light?</summary>
    <p>
      Excessive duration without a dark period can stress plants, but this is less common than insufficient light.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is a sunny window enough?</summary>
    <p>
      It depends on season and orientation. Late winter light is often weaker than expected.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do cool-season crops need 16 hours?</summary>
    <p>
      They benefit from consistent light, though they tolerate moderate conditions better than warm-season crops.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does location (U.S. vs Canada) change this?</summary>
    <p>
      Latitude and daylight length matter more than national borders.
