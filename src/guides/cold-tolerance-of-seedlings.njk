  <h1>Cold Tolerance of Seedlings: Temperature Survival Guide</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Small temperature changes make a big difference in seedling survival.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Seedling cold tolerance changes rapidly between 45°F (7°C) and 32°F (0°C).</strong>
    Growth slows first, then stress develops, and finally freeze injury occurs.
    Understanding these thresholds helps you prevent avoidable damage.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Most warm-season seedlings begin slowing below 50°F (10°C), experience stress near 40°F (4°C), and risk freeze damage at 32°F (0°C).</strong>
    Cool-season crops tolerate lower temperatures but are not immune to prolonged freezing.

  <h2>45°F (7°C): Growth Slowdown Zone</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Tomatoes and peppers slow noticeably</li>
    <li>Root growth declines</li>
    <li>No freeze damage yet</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Repeated nights at this temperature delay development.

<section class="card">
  <h2>40°F (4°C): Stress Likely</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cold stress symptoms may appear</li>
    <li>Leaves may darken or droop</li>
    <li>Growth may pause</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Injury becomes more likely if exposure repeats.

  <h2>35°F (2°C): Injury Possible</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Patchy frost may form in low areas</li>
    <li>Tender seedlings risk tissue damage</li>
    <li>Duration becomes critical</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some plants survive brief dips.
    Repeated exposure increases risk.

<section class="card">
  <h2>32°F (0°C): Freeze Threshold</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Ice crystals form inside plant tissue</li>
    <li>Leaf collapse likely</li>
    <li>Tender annuals may die</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A brief light frost may cause limited damage.
    A sustained freeze can be severe.

  <h2>Warm-Season vs Cool-Season Crops</h2>

  <p>
    Warm-season crops (tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers) are sensitive to cold stress.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool-season crops (kale, cabbage, spinach) tolerate lower temperatures but can still suffer during prolonged freezing.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Duration Matters More Than a Single Number</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Brief dip: Often survivable</li>
    <li>Several hours below freezing: Damage increases</li>
    <li>Repeated cold nights: Growth delays accumulate</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Temperature thresholds and frost probability work together.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>At what temperature do seedlings die?</summary>
    <p>
      Many tender seedlings die during sustained exposure below 32°F (0°C).
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can seedlings survive 40°F (4°C)?</summary>
    <p>
      Often yes, but stress and slowed growth are common.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does frost always mean death?</summary>
    <p>
      No. Light frost may damage leaves without killing the plant.
