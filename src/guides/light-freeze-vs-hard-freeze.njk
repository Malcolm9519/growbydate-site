  <h1>Light Freeze vs Hard Freeze: What’s the Difference?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Not all freezes cause the same level of damage.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>A light freeze occurs when temperatures briefly dip to 32°F (0°C) or slightly below.</strong>
    A hard freeze typically involves temperatures of 28°F (-2°C) or lower for several hours, causing widespread plant damage.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Light freezes cause surface-level damage.</strong>
    <strong>Hard freezes penetrate deeper into plant tissue and soil.</strong>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Light Freeze:</strong> Around 32°F (0°C), brief exposure</li>
    <li><strong>Hard Freeze:</strong> 28°F (-2°C) or colder, sustained exposure</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The lower the temperature and the longer it lasts, the more severe the damage.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>What Happens During a Light Freeze</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Frost forms on exposed surfaces</li>
    <li>Leaf edges may darken</li>
    <li>Some tender foliage may collapse</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Roots often remain unaffected if soil temperatures stay above freezing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many cool-season crops tolerate light freezes.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What Happens During a Hard Freeze</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Ice forms inside plant cells</li>
    <li>Cell walls rupture</li>
    <li>Stems become water-soaked and collapse</li>
    <li>Growing points may die</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Tender annuals such as tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and basil rarely survive a hard freeze.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Temperature Threshold Comparison</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>32°F (0°C):</strong> Frost formation possible</li>
    <li><strong>30°F (-1°C):</strong> Increased plant stress</li>
    <li><strong>28°F (-2°C):</strong> Hard freeze threshold</li>
    <li><strong>Below 25°F (-4°C):</strong> Severe tissue damage likely</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Duration matters as much as temperature.
    Several hours below freezing increases risk significantly.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil Temperature Matters Too</h2>

  <p>
    In a light freeze, soil may retain warmth and protect roots.
    In a hard freeze, soil temperatures can drop enough to affect shallow root systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clear, calm nights increase freeze severity due to radiational cooling.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>When Each Type Typically Occurs</h2>

  <p>
    Light freezes often occur near the beginning or end of the frost season.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hard freezes are more common deeper into fall or during cold spring outbreaks
    in northern U.S. states and comparable Canadian regions.

  <h2>What to Do Before a Light Freeze</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Cover sensitive plants overnight</li>
    <li>Water soil earlier in the day</li>
    <li>Move containers indoors</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Many plants recover if the freeze is brief.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What to Do Before a Hard Freeze</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Harvest mature crops</li>
    <li>Use frost cloth with support structures</li>
    <li>Bring container plants inside</li>
    <li>Prepare for seasonal shutdown</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A hard freeze often signals the end of the growing season for tender crops.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Is 30°F (-1°C) a hard freeze?</summary>
    <p>
      Not usually. It is closer to a light freeze, depending on duration.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Will plants survive a light freeze?</summary>
    <p>
      Many cool-season crops do. Tender crops may experience leaf damage.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>At what temperature do most annuals die?</summary>
    <p>
      Sustained temperatures below 28°F (-2°C) often cause widespread death.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does freeze duration matter?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Several hours below freezing causes more damage than a brief dip.
    </p>
