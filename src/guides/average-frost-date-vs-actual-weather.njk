  <h1>❄️Average Frost Date vs 🌤️Actual Weather: What Gardeners Should Know</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Averages reduce risk. Weather determines outcomes.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>An average frost date is based on long-term climate probability — not a guarantee.</strong>
    Actual weather in a given year may bring frost earlier or later than historical averages.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Average frost dates represent statistical risk thresholds.</strong>
    They are typically calculated using 30-year climate records.
  </p>

  <p>
    Actual yearly weather can vary significantly from those averages.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Understanding Probability Levels</h2>

  <p>
    Frost dates are often reported at:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>50% probability:</strong> Frost occurs half the time after this date</li>
    <li><strong>30% probability:</strong> Lower risk threshold</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A “last frost date” does not mean frost cannot occur afterward —
    only that it becomes less likely.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why Weather Can Differ from Averages</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Late-season Arctic air outbreaks</li>
    <li>Clear, calm radiational cooling nights</li>
    <li>Elevation differences</li>
    <li>Urban vs rural heat retention</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Microclimates within the same zone may experience frost on different nights.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Example Scenario</h2>

  <p>
    If your average last frost date is May 15:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Most years will be frost-free after that date.</li>
    <li>Some years may still see frost May 20 or later.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The average reflects probability, not certainty.

  <h2>How Gardeners Should Use Frost Data</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Use the average date to plan seed timing.</li>
    <li>Monitor 7–10 day forecasts before transplanting.</li>
    <li>Protect plants if temperatures approach 32°F (0°C).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Combining History with Forecasts</h2>

  <p>
    Frost dates provide long-term structure.
    Weather forecasts provide short-term adjustments.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most reliable planting decisions combine both.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can frost happen after the average last frost date?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Averages reduce risk but do not eliminate it.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is the frost date wrong if frost happens later?</summary>
    <p>
      No. It reflects statistical probability.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I ignore frost dates and rely only on forecasts?</summary>
    <p>
      No. Use frost dates for structure and forecasts for adjustment.
    </p>
