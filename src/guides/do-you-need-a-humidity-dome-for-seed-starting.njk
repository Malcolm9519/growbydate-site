  <h1>Do You Need a Humidity Dome for Seed Starting?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Domes help with germination — but only temporarily.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>You do not strictly need a humidity dome to start seeds, but it can improve germination by maintaining consistent surface moisture.</strong>
    Once seedlings sprout, however, continued use can increase fungal disease risk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before adjusting equipment, confirm your indoor timing with the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>
    so seedlings are not kept indoors longer than necessary.

  <h2>What a Humidity Dome Does</h2>

  <p>
    A humidity dome traps moisture above seed trays, creating a stable microclimate.
  </p>

  <p>
    During germination, seeds require:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Consistent moisture</li>
    <li>Stable temperature</li>
    <li>Minimal surface drying</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Domes reduce evaporation and limit the need for frequent watering.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>When a Dome Helps</h2>

  <p>
    A dome is most useful when:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Indoor air is dry</li>
    <li>Heating systems reduce humidity</li>
    <li>Seed trays dry quickly at the surface</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Warm-season crops such as peppers and eggplant may benefit from consistent moisture during slower germination.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>When to Remove the Dome</h2>

  <p>
    Once seedlings emerge, remove the dome immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Continued enclosure increases:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Humidity buildup</li>
    <li>Fungal disease risk</li>
    <li>Damping off</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Airflow becomes more important after germination.

  <h2>Domes Do Not Replace Proper Watering</h2>

  <p>
    Overwatering remains one of the most common seed-starting mistakes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even with a dome:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Soil should be moist, not saturated.</li>
    <li>Drainage must be adequate.</li>
    <li>Standing water increases rot risk.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Container choice and drainage matter more than enclosure.

<section class="card">
  <h2>Cool-Season Crops Often Don’t Need Domes</h2>

  <p>
    Broccoli, cabbage, lettuce, and kale germinate reliably in moderate indoor conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your home maintains steady temperatures and soil remains moist, a dome may not provide significant benefit.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Short-Season Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    In colder northern climates across the U.S. and comparable Canadian regions, seeds are often started earlier in the year when indoor air is dry due to heating systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    During that period:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Surface drying happens faster.</li>
    <li>Humidity levels may be low.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A dome can improve early-stage moisture stability — but timing remains the larger variable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Starting too early extends indoor duration and increases disease exposure.
  </p>

  <h2>Alternatives to Domes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Bottom watering</li>
    <li>Monitoring moisture daily</li>
    <li>Using a lightly covered tray temporarily</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Moisture consistency matters more than the specific method used.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I use plastic wrap instead of a dome?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes, temporarily. Remove it as soon as seedlings emerge.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do tomatoes require a humidity dome?</summary>
    <p>
      Not usually, if soil moisture is maintained consistently.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does a dome increase damping off?</summary>
    <p>
      It can if left on after germination.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is this different in Canada?</summary>
    <p>
      Indoor humidity levels, not location, determine usefulness.
