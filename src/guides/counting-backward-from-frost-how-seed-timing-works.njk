  <h1>Counting Backward from Frost: How Seed Timing Works</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Frost dates anchor your planting schedule.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Indoor seed timing works by counting backward from your average last spring frost date.</strong>
    Each crop requires a specific number of weeks indoors before transplanting.
    The frost date defines the outdoor safety boundary.

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Start with your average last frost date, then count backward based on crop requirements.</strong>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tomatoes: 6–8 weeks</li>
    <li>Peppers: 8–10 weeks</li>
    <li>Brassicas: 4–6 weeks</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This aligns indoor growth with safe outdoor transplant timing.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Frost Is the Anchor</h2>

  <p>
    Warm-season crops cannot tolerate freezing temperatures (32°F / 0°C).
    Even cold stress below 50°F (10°C) can slow growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Counting backward ensures seedlings are:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Large enough at transplant</li>
    <li>Not root-bound or overgrown</li>
    <li>Moved outdoors when frost risk has declined</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Worked Example: Zone 4 vs Zone 6</h2>

  <p>
    Consider two locations:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Zone 4:</strong> Last frost May 30</li>
    <li><strong>Zone 6:</strong> Last frost April 25</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Tomatoes (6–8 weeks indoors):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Zone 4 start: Early to mid-April</li>
    <li>Zone 6 start: Early to mid-March</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The difference is not the zone number —
    it is the frost date.
  </p>

  <h2>Counting Forward for Fall Frost</h2>

  <p>
    Frost math works both directions.
  </p>

  <p>
    For long-season crops:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Identify your first fall frost date.</li>
    <li>Count backward required days to maturity.</li>
    <li>Ensure harvest occurs before frost risk rises.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In short-season climates, losing even one week early can reduce yield significantly.

  <h2>Common Timing Mistakes</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Starting seeds based on the month instead of frost timing</li>
    <li>Ignoring soil temperature at transplant</li>
    <li>Failing to adjust for short-term forecasts</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Temperature Still Matters After Frost</h2>

  <p>
    Even when frost risk declines, transplant success improves when:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Nighttime lows remain above 50°F (10°C)</li>
    <li>Soil reaches 60°F (16°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Why count backward instead of forward?</summary>
    <p>
      Frost defines transplant safety. Counting backward aligns indoor growth to that boundary.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does this apply in both U.S. and Canadian climates?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Frost-based timing works anywhere with seasonal freezing.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if frost comes late?</summary>
    <p>
      Monitor short-term forecasts and delay transplanting if needed.
