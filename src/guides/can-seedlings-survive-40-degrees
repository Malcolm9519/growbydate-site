<section class="card">

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Most cool-season seedlings can survive 40°F (4°C) without damage. Most warm-season seedlings will not die at 40°F, but they can stall, discolor, or suffer stress that slows growth for weeks.</p>

<p>Forty degrees is above freezing, so it won’t cause frost damage. The risk depends entirely on the crop type and how long the temperature stays low. A brief dip to 40°F overnight is very different from multiple nights in the low 40s.</p>

<h2>What 40°F Actually Means for Seedlings</h2>

<h3>Cool-Season Seedlings (Usually Safe at 40°F)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lettuce</li>
<li>Kale</li>
<li>Spinach</li>
<li>Broccoli</li>
<li>Cabbage</li>
<li>Onions</li>
</ul>

<p>These crops are adapted to chilly soil and air. At 40°F, growth slows but plants remain stable. Damage is unlikely unless temperatures drop closer to 32°F.</p>

<h3>Warm-Season Seedlings (Risk of Stress)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tomatoes</li>
<li>Peppers</li>
<li>Cucumbers</li>
<li>Squash</li>
<li>Basil</li>
</ul>

<p>Warm-season plants prefer nights above 50°F. At 40°F, they may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop growing</li>
<li>Turn purple or yellow</li>
<li>Wilt the next day</li>
<li>Develop long-term stunting</li>
</ul>

<p>Repeated exposure is more damaging than one cold night.</p>

<h2>How Long Is Too Long at 40°F?</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>1 night:</strong> Usually minor stress</li>
<li><strong>2–3 nights:</strong> Growth stall likely</li>
<li><strong>5+ consecutive nights:</strong> Setback of 1–3 weeks for warm crops</li>
</ul>

<p>If soil temperatures remain under 50°F, warm-season roots struggle to function properly.</p>

<h2>What to Do If 40°F Is in the Forecast</h2>

<ul>
<li>Cover seedlings with row fabric or frost cloth</li>
<li>Use overturned pots or buckets overnight</li>
<li>Water soil during the day (moist soil retains heat better)</li>
<li>Delay transplanting warm-season crops</li>
</ul>

<p>If you haven’t transplanted yet, it’s often safer to wait. See <a href="/guides/when-to-transplant-seedlings-outdoors/">when to transplant seedlings outdoors</a> for safe timing guidelines.</p>

<h2>Should You Delay Planting?</h2>

<p>If overnight lows are consistently below 45°F, delay warm-season crops. Use the <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a> to adjust your transplant timing based on your last frost date.</p>

<h2>What to Do If Seedlings Already Experienced 40°F</h2>

<ul>
<li>Wait 48 hours before judging damage</li>
<li>Look for new leaf growth</li>
<li>Avoid fertilizing stressed plants immediately</li>
<li>Keep soil evenly moist</li>
</ul>

<p>Most plants recover if temperatures rebound quickly.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Will 40°F kill tomato seedlings?</h3>
<p>Unlikely in one night, but repeated exposure can stunt them significantly.</p>

<h3>Is 40°F considered frost?</h3>
<p>No. Frost forms at or below 32°F, though microclimates can dip lower than forecast.</p>

<h3>Should I bring seedlings inside at 40°F?</h3>
<p>Bring warm-season seedlings inside if possible. Cool-season seedlings can usually stay out.</p>

<h3>Does wind make 40°F worse?</h3>
<p>Yes. Wind increases plant stress and accelerates heat loss.</p>
