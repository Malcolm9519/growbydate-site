  <h1>Why Frost Dates Matter More Than Planting Calendars</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Calendars are general. Frost dates are specific.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Frost dates provide location-specific probability data. Planting calendars provide generalized estimates.</strong>
    In cold climates, relying on frost timing leads to more accurate seed-start and transplant decisions than following a static calendar.
  </p>

  <h2>Direct Answer</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Frost dates reflect historical temperature probability in your area.</strong>
    Planting calendars group regions into broad categories that may not reflect your specific frost timing.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short-season climates, even a one-week miscalculation can affect harvest.
  </p>

  <h2>What Planting Calendars Get Wrong</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>They assume uniform conditions across wide regions.</li>
    <li>They do not adjust for yearly variation.</li>
    <li>They rarely account for microclimates.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Calendars can be useful starting points — but they are not precise.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What Frost Dates Actually Represent</h2>

  <p>
    Frost dates are based on long-term climate records, typically 30 years.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Average last spring frost</li>
    <li>Average first fall frost</li>
    <li>Probability-based risk thresholds</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This data helps you estimate your frost-free growing window.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Zones vs. Frost Dates</h2>

  <p>
    USDA zones describe average winter minimum temperatures.
    They do not tell you when frost ends in spring or begins in fall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cold-climate regions across northern U.S. states and comparable Canadian areas
    may share similar frost timelines even if their zone labels differ slightly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Frost timing determines planting windows — not winter low extremes.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Why This Matters for Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Indoor seed-start timing depends on:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Last spring frost date</li>
    <li>Weeks to transplant size</li>
    <li>Crop-specific temperature thresholds</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Starting too early leads to overgrown seedlings.
    Starting too late reduces harvest potential.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Temperature Still Matters After Frost</h2>

  <p>
    Even after frost risk declines, warm-season crops prefer:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Nighttime lows above 50°F (10°C)</li>
    <li>Soil temperatures near 60°F (16°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Frost dates define risk boundaries.
    Temperature stability determines growth quality.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Cold-Climate Gardening Requires Probability Thinking</h2>

  <p>
    In shorter growing seasons:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Late frost can still occur after the average date</li>
    <li>Early fall frost can cut harvest short</li>
    <li>Buffers improve reliability</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Treat frost dates as risk thresholds, not guarantees.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>How to Use Frost Dates Correctly</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Identify your average last and first frost dates.</li>
    <li>Count backward for indoor seed starting.</li>
    <li>Monitor nighttime temperatures before transplanting.</li>
    <li>Use short-term forecasts to adjust timing.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Are planting calendars useless?</summary>
    <p>
      No. They are helpful as general guides but lack location-specific precision.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Are frost dates always accurate?</summary>
    <p>
      They are probability-based averages, not guarantees.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do zones determine planting dates?</summary>
    <p>
      Zones describe winter minimum temperatures, not frost timing.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is frost timing more important in cold climates?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Short growing seasons increase the impact of timing errors.
