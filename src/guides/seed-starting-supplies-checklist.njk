  <h1>Seed Starting Supplies Checklist</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    What you actually need — and what you can skip.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    Starting seeds indoors doesn’t require a complicated setup.
    Most problems come from poor timing or weak light — not from missing specialty equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before buying supplies, calculate your start dates using the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
    Timing comes first. Supplies support the timing.

  <h2>Seed Trays or Containers</h2>

  <p>
    You’ll need containers with drainage holes and a solid tray underneath to catch water.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cell trays (most common and efficient)</li>
    <li>A bottom tray for watering</li>
    <li>Optional humidity dome for germination</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Reusable trays are worth it if you plan to start seeds every year.
    Budget options work too, as long as they drain properly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not sure when to fill them? See
    <a href="/guides/when-to-start-seeds-indoors/">When to Start Seeds Indoors</a>.

<section class="card">
  <h2>Seed Starting Mix (Not Garden Soil)</h2>

  <p>
    Use a mix labeled specifically for seed starting.
    It should be light, sterile, and well-draining.
  </p>

  <p>
    Avoid:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Garden soil</li>
    <li>Heavy compost blends</li>
    <li>Dense potting soil meant for large containers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Seedlings need oxygen around their roots. Dense soil holds too much moisture and increases the risk of damping off.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Grow Lights (Often the Missing Piece)</h2>

  <p>
    A bright window is rarely enough light in late winter.
    Weak light leads to tall, thin seedlings that struggle after transplanting.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simple LED shop lights positioned 2–3 inches above the seedlings work well.
    The goal is compact, sturdy growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’ve started seeds that became stretched or floppy, read
    <a href="/guides/starting-seeds-too-early/">What Happens If You Start Seeds Too Early?</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Heat Mats (Optional)</h2>

  <p>
    Heat mats are helpful for warm-season crops such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Tomatoes</li>
    <li>Peppers</li>
    <li>Eggplant</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    They are not required for most cool-season crops.
    If your home stays around 65–70°F (18–21°C), many seeds will germinate without additional heat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use heat as a targeted tool, not a default purchase.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Labels</h2>

  <p>
    All seedlings look similar at first.
    Label immediately after planting.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Plastic plant tags</li>
    <li>Waterproof marker</li>
    <li>Masking tape (short term)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Do not rely on memory.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Watering Method</h2>

  <p>
    Bottom watering is best.
    Pour water into the tray beneath the cells and allow the soil to absorb moisture from below.
  </p>

  <p>
    This encourages deeper root growth and reduces surface fungus.
  </p>

  <p>
    Avoid heavy overhead watering once seedlings emerge.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Optional: Gentle Airflow</h2>

  <p>
    A small fan set on low helps strengthen stems and reduce mold.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even light, occasional airflow improves seedling resilience.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What You Don’t Need (At First)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Grow tents</li>
    <li>Automated watering systems</li>
    <li>Fertilizer in the first few weeks</li>
    <li>Large pots before transplanting</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Strong seedlings come from correct timing and steady care — not complex equipment.
  </p>

  <h2>Before You Buy, Confirm Your Dates</h2>

  <p>
    Generic calendars don’t account for your local frost date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>
    to calculate indoor start dates based on your location.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you don’t know your frost date, start here:

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Start with accurate timing.</li>
    <li>Use light, well-draining seed starting mix.</li>
    <li>Provide strong overhead light.</li>
    <li>Keep watering consistent.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once your supplies are ready, calculate your exact start window using the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
