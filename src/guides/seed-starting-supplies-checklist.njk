  <h1>Seed Starting Supplies Checklist</h1>

    Organized by growth stage — not by shopping list.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    Most seed starting problems aren’t caused by missing equipment.
    They’re caused by poor timing, weak light, or extended indoor periods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before buying anything, calculate your start window using the

    Supplies support timing. They don’t replace it.

  <h2>Stage 1: Germination</h2>

  <p>
    At this stage, seeds need moisture, warmth (sometimes), and oxygen.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Seed trays or small containers with drainage</li>
    <li>Seed starting mix (lightweight and sterile)</li>
    <li>Optional humidity dome (removed after sprouting)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Garden soil is too dense for indoor germination.
    A proper <a href="/guides/what-is-seed-starting-mix/">seed starting mix</a>
    reduces damping-off risk and improves root development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Warm-season crops may benefit from bottom heat in cooler homes.
    Heat mats are helpful, but not required in every setup.
  </p>

  <h2>Stage 2: Early Growth</h2>

  <p>
    Once seedlings emerge, light becomes the limiting factor.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Strong overhead grow lights</li>
    <li>12–16 hours of consistent daily light</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Leggy seedlings are almost always caused by insufficient light,
    not lack of fertilizer. If stems stretch or lean,
    review your lighting setup before adjusting nutrients.
  </p>

  <p>
    Airflow also becomes important once leaves appear.
    Gentle circulation reduces fungal pressure and strengthens stems.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Stage 3: Root Expansion</h2>

  <p>
    As roots fill starter cells, you may need to move seedlings into larger containers.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Appropriately sized pots</li>
    <li>Slightly richer potting mix (if potting up)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Potting up is only necessary when roots become restricted.
    If transplant is near, increasing container size may add stress without benefit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Correct start timing minimizes unnecessary potting cycles.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Stage 4: Nutrition</h2>

  <p>
    Seeds contain stored nutrients for early growth.
    Fertilizer becomes useful only after true leaves develop.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Diluted liquid fertilizer (¼ strength to start)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Overfeeding indoors causes more damage than underfeeding.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Watering Method</h2>

  <p>
    Bottom watering is preferred.
    It encourages deeper root growth and reduces surface fungus.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overwatering — not lack of fertilizer — is one of the most common seedling problems.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What Most Beginners Overbuy</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Grow tents</li>
    <li>Automated watering systems</li>
    <li>Full-strength fertilizer</li>
    <li>Large containers too early</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Strong seedlings come from correct scheduling and consistent light —
    not complex equipment.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Start with accurate timing.</li>
    <li>Use light, well-draining seed starting mix.</li>
    <li>Prioritize strong overhead light.</li>
    <li>Increase container size only when roots demand it.</li>
    <li>Fertilize lightly and only after true leaves form.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Supplies support your schedule.
