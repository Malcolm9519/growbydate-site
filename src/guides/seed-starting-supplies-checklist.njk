  <h1>Seed Starting Supplies Checklist</h1>
  <p class="tagline">
    What you actually need — and what you can skip.
  </p>
  <p class="lede">
    Starting seeds indoors doesn’t require a complicated setup.
    Most problems come from poor timing, weak light, or extended indoor periods — not from missing specialty equipment.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before buying supplies, calculate your start dates using the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
    Timing comes first. Supplies support the timing.

  <h2>Seed Trays or Containers</h2>

  <p>
    You’ll need containers with drainage holes and a solid tray underneath to catch water.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Cell trays (most common and efficient)</li>
    <li>A bottom tray for watering</li>
    <li>An optional humidity dome for early germination</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Container size should match how long seedlings remain indoors.
    If you start too early, even good trays can become cramped — which is why correct timing matters more than upgrading equipment.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re unsure which container size fits your indoor duration,
    our guide to <a href="/guides/best-containers-for-starting-seeds-indoors/">starting seed containers</a>
    explains the tradeoffs.

  <h2>Seed Starting Mix (Not Garden Soil)</h2>

  <p>
    Use a mix labeled specifically for seed starting.
    It should be light, sterile, and well-draining.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dense soil holds too much moisture and increases the risk of damping off —
    especially if humidity stays high after seedlings emerge.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Grow Lights (Often the Missing Piece)</h2>

  <p>
    A bright window is rarely enough light in late winter.
    Most seedlings need 12–16 hours of bright, close light daily to stay compact.
  </p>

  <p>
    If seedlings become tall and thin, the issue is usually insufficient light rather than fertilizer.
    You can read more about that in our guide on
    <a href="/guides/why-seedlings-get-leggy/">leggy seedlings</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re unsure whether supplemental lighting is necessary in your home,
    <a href="/guides/can-you-start-seeds-without-grow-lights/">this breakdown of starting without grow lights</a>
    explains when natural light is enough.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Heat Mats (Optional and Crop-Specific)</h2>

  <p>
    Heat mats can improve germination for warm-season crops like tomatoes and peppers,
    particularly in cooler homes.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are not required for most cool-season crops.
    Many homes maintain adequate temperatures without supplemental heat.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re unsure whether soil warmth is limiting germination,
    we explain when bottom heat actually helps in our guide on
    <a href="/guides/do-you-need-a-heat-mat-to-start-seeds/">using heat mats for seed starting</a>.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Watering and Airflow</h2>

  <p>
    Bottom watering encourages deeper roots and reduces surface fungus.
    Avoid heavy overhead watering once seedlings emerge.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gentle airflow also strengthens stems and lowers disease pressure.
    In still indoor air, seedlings may remain weak or damp longer than ideal.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Labels</h2>

  <p>
    All seedlings look similar at first.
    Label immediately after planting.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Plastic plant tags</li>
    <li>Waterproof marker</li>
    <li>Simple tape (short term)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Do not rely on memory.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>What You Don’t Need (At First)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Grow tents</li>
    <li>Automated watering systems</li>
    <li>Fertilizer in the first few weeks</li>
    <li>Large pots before transplanting</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Strong seedlings come from correct timing and steady care — not complex equipment.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Start with accurate timing.</li>
    <li>Use light, well-draining seed starting mix.</li>
    <li>Provide strong overhead light.</li>
    <li>Adjust warmth and airflow only if needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once your supplies are ready, calculate your exact start window using the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
