    <h2>What We Help With</h2>
    <p class="muted">Common timing problems, solved with dates.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Seed starting timing</h3>
  <p>
    Know when to start seeds indoors by counting backward from your last frost date.
    Avoid starting too early or too late.
  </p>

  <h3>Frost-aware planning</h3>
  <p>
    Use last frost and first frost as anchor points for planting decisions—more reliable than generic calendars.
  </p>

  <h3>Short growing seasons</h3>
  <p>
    If your season is tight or unpredictable, precision matters.
    Tools based on your actual dates help you plan with less guesswork.

    <h2>Why GrowByDate</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    Many gardening resources focus on broad climate zones or general planting charts.
    GrowByDate focuses on dates.
  </p>

  <p>
    Last frost, first frost, and transplant timing usually explain what succeeds in a home garden better than generic advice.
    The goal here is straightforward: clear timing you can apply immediately.
  </p>

  <p class="muted">
    Start with the Seed Starting Planner, then use the guides to understand the “why” behind the dates.
