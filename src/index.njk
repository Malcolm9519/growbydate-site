  <h1>Plan Your Garden by Date, Not Guesswork</h1>

  <p class="lede">
    Most planting decisions depend on two dates: your last frost and your first frost.
    GrowByDate turns those dates into clear, practical planting windows.

    <h2>Built for Practical Gardeners - Why Date-Based Planning Works</h2>
  </div>

<p>GrowByDate focuses on clear, date-based planning. 
Instead of general advice, our tools help you calculate when to start seeds, transplant outdoors, and prepare for frost — based on your actual growing season.
</p>

  <p>
    Climate zones describe average winter lows.
    Frost dates determine planting success.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your last frost anchors spring timing.
    Your first frost anchors fall timing.
    These two numbers shape most home garden decisions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us help you turn those dates
    into usable planting windows—especially for shorter or unpredictable growing seasons.
