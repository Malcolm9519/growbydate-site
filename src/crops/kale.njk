      <h1>Growing Kale in Short Growing Seasons</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Reliable, cold-tolerant, and one of the best short-season crops.</p>
      <p class="lede">
        Kale handles cool weather better than most vegetables and keeps producing into fall.
        It’s a great “backbone crop” for short seasons.

      <h2>Quick Planning Reference</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Indoor start:</strong> 6–8 weeks before last frost (optional)</li>
        <li><strong>Transplant / outdoor timing:</strong> ~2 weeks before to ~1 week after last frost</li>
        <li><strong>Days to maturity:</strong> 50–70 days (baby leaves sooner)</li>
        <li><strong>Frost tolerance:</strong> High (light frosts improve flavor)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Best Varieties for Short Seasons</h2>
      <p>
        Most kale works well in cool climates. Choose based on how you want to harvest.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Curly types for steady leaf harvest</li>
        <li>Lacinato (dinosaur) for tender leaves</li>
        <li>Russian types for faster, mild-flavored growth</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="fine muted">
        Baby-leaf harvests mature much sooner than full-size plants.

    <section class="card">
      <h2>Common Short-Season Mistakes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Planting too late for fall.</strong> Growth slows sharply as day length decreases.</li>
        <li><strong>Skipping steady watering.</strong> Uneven moisture can lead to tough leaves.</li>
        <li><strong>Overcrowding.</strong> Give plants room if you want full leaves all season.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fall Planning Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Kale is one of the best fall crops. It tolerates light frosts and can keep producing with protection.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start fall kale early enough to size up before cold arrives</li>
        <li>Use row cover to extend harvest and reduce pest pressure</li>
        <li>Harvest outer leaves regularly to keep plants productive</li>
      </ul>
