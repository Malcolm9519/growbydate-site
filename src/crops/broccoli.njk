  <h1>Growing Broccoli in Short Growing Seasons</h1>
  <p class="tagline">Broccoli likes cool weather — plan for steady growth, not heat.</p>
  <p class="lede">
    Broccoli performs well in cool climates, but it needs consistent moisture and timing.
    In short seasons, an indoor start and a clear transplant window improve reliability.

  <h2>Quick Planning Reference</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Indoor start:</strong> 6–8 weeks before last frost</li>
    <li><strong>Transplant / outdoor timing:</strong> ~2 weeks before to ~0–1 week after last frost</li>
    <li><strong>Days to maturity:</strong> 65–85 days depending on variety</li>
    <li><strong>Frost tolerance:</strong> Moderate to high (light frosts are usually fine)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Best Varieties for Short Seasons</h2>
  <p>
    Look for early-maturing broccoli and varieties that form heads reliably in cool conditions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Early varieties (around 60–70 days)</li>
    <li>Compact types for tight spacing and faster harvest</li>
    <li>Cold-tolerant selections for fall planting</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="fine muted">
    Broccoli timing is sensitive: too hot can cause loose heads; too cold can slow growth.

  <h2>Common Short-Season Mistakes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Starting too late.</strong> Heat stress can hit before heads form.</li>
    <li><strong>Letting plants dry out.</strong> Even moisture supports steady head development.</li>
    <li><strong>Overcrowding.</strong> Tight spacing can reduce head size in short seasons.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Planning Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Fall broccoli can be excellent if planted early enough. It needs time to size up before cold slows growth.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Start fall broccoli earlier than you would for leafy greens</li>
    <li>Use protection to reduce frost stress and wind damage</li>
    <li>Harvest promptly at tight head stage for best quality</li>
  </ul>
