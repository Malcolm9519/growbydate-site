      <h1>Growing Tomatoes in Short Growing Seasons</h1>
      <p class="tagline">Timing, variety choice, and protection matter more than anything else.</p>
      <p class="lede">
        Tomatoes are one of the most rewarding crops in a home garden — but in shorter climates,
        they require intentional planning. With the right start date and variety selection,
        reliable harvests are absolutely possible.

      <h2>Quick Planning Reference</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Indoor start:</strong> 6–8 weeks before your average last frost</li>
        <li><strong>Transplant:</strong> 1–3 weeks after last frost (when nights are consistently above 50°F / 10°C)</li>
        <li><strong>Days to maturity:</strong> 55–85 days depending on variety</li>
        <li><strong>Frost tolerance:</strong> None (protect from all frost)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Choosing the Right Varieties</h2>

      <p>
        In short growing seasons, focus on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Early or short-season varieties (55–70 days)</li>
        <li>Determinate types for quicker production</li>
        <li>Smaller fruit types (cherry, saladette) for reliability</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Large beefsteak varieties often require longer seasons and warmer nights to fully mature.

      <h2>Common Short-Season Mistakes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Starting too late indoors.</strong> This shortens harvest time.</li>
        <li><strong>Transplanting too early.</strong> Cold soil delays growth significantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring fall frost planning.</strong> Fruit needs time to ripen before first frost.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Can Tomatoes Finish in Your Season?</h2>

      <p>
        Count backward from your first frost date using your variety’s days to maturity.
        If your remaining warm days are tight, consider:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Using row covers in early fall</li>
        <li>Pruning excess growth mid-season</li>
        <li>Removing late flowers 4–6 weeks before frost</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Reliable maturity depends on both calendar days and temperature consistency.
