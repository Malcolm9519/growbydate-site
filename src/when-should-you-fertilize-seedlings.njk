  <h1>When Should You Fertilize Seedlings?</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Not immediately — and not at full strength.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Most seedlings do not need fertilizer during germination.</strong>
    Seeds contain stored energy that supports early growth. Fertilizing too soon can stress young roots and encourage weak top growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before adjusting nutrients, confirm your indoor timing using the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
    Seedlings that stay indoors too long often appear nutrient-deficient when the real issue is extended indoor duration.

  <h2>Why Seeds Don’t Need Immediate Fertilizer</h2>

  <p>
    Seeds contain a built-in nutrient supply called the endosperm.
    This supports:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Germination</li>
    <li>Root emergence</li>
    <li>Initial leaf development</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    During this stage, moisture and oxygen matter more than nutrients.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is one reason <a href="/guides/what-is-seed-starting-mix/">seed starting mix</a>
    typically contains little to no fertilizer.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>The Right Time to Begin Feeding</h2>

  <p>
    Fertilizer becomes useful after seedlings develop:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>At least one set of true leaves</li>
    <li>Established root systems</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For most crops, this is 2–3 weeks after germination.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this stage, begin with a diluted liquid fertilizer at approximately one-quarter strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gradually increase to half strength as plants grow — but avoid full-strength applications indoors.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Signs You’re Fertilizing Too Early</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Leaf tip burn</li>
    <li>Stalled growth</li>
    <li>Salt buildup on soil surface</li>
    <li>Sudden yellowing after feeding</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Indoors, overfeeding causes more problems than underfeeding.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Weak Growth Isn’t Always a Nutrient Problem</h2>

  <p>
    Pale or leggy seedlings are often blamed on nutrient deficiency.
    In most cases, light is the limiting factor.
  </p>

  <p>
    If stems are thin and stretched, review your lighting setup before increasing fertilizer.
    Our guide on <a href="/guides/why-seedlings-get-leggy/">why seedlings get leggy</a>
    explains the difference.

<section class="card">
  <h2>Warm-Season vs Cool-Season Crops</h2>

  <p>
    Warm-season crops (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant) grow rapidly once established
    and may benefit from regular light feeding indoors.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool-season crops (broccoli, cabbage, lettuce) generally require less aggressive feeding during early stages.
  </p>

  <p>
    Excess nitrogen on cool-season crops can produce large, soft leaves that transplant poorly.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Short-Season Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    In colder northern climates across the U.S. and comparable Canadian regions,
    seedlings are often started during low-light months.
  </p>

  <p>
    When light is limited:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Growth slows naturally.</li>
    <li>Nutrient demand decreases.</li>
    <li>Overfeeding increases risk of weak growth.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Fertilizer cannot compensate for insufficient light.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Should You Fertilize Before Transplanting?</h2>

  <p>
    Light feeding can continue until transplant.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, if transplant timing is approaching,
    focus more on hardening off than increasing nutrients.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harden seedlings gradually before outdoor planting to reduce stress.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I use regular garden fertilizer on seedlings?</summary>
    <p>
      Only if heavily diluted. Seedlings are sensitive to concentrated nutrients.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What if my seedlings are yellow?</summary>
    <p>
      Check light and watering first. Nutrient deficiency is not always the cause.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do I need fertilizer if I’m transplanting soon?</summary>
    <p>
      Not usually. Healthy seedlings can transition outdoors without heavy feeding.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does this timing apply in both the U.S. and Canada?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Indoor nutrient needs depend on growth stage, not geography.
    </p>
