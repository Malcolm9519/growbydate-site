  <h1>What Is Seed Starting Mix (And Why Not Use Garden Soil?)</h1>

  <p class="tagline">
    Texture and drainage matter more than nutrients at the seed stage.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Seed starting mix is a lightweight, sterile growing medium designed for germination.</strong>
    It drains quickly, holds consistent moisture, and reduces the risk of fungal disease. Garden soil and heavy potting mixes are usually too dense for young seedlings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before filling trays, confirm your start timing with the
    <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a>.
    Correct timing reduces how long seedlings must rely on indoor conditions.

  <h2>What Makes Seed Starting Mix Different?</h2>

  <p>
    Seed starting mix is formulated for early root development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most blends contain:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Peat moss or coco coir (moisture retention)</li>
    <li>Perlite or vermiculite (aeration and drainage)</li>
    <li>No added compost or field soil</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The goal is a fine, loose texture that allows oxygen to reach developing roots.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Garden Soil Causes Problems Indoors</h2>

  <p>
    Garden soil works outdoors because natural drainage, microbial balance, and temperature fluctuations regulate moisture.
    Indoors, those balancing factors are missing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Garden soil indoors can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Compact easily</li>
    <li>Drain poorly</li>
    <li>Introduce pathogens</li>
    <li>Increase damping off risk</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Damping off causes seedlings to collapse at the soil line.
    It is more common in dense, wet growing media.
  </p>

  <h2>Seed Starting Mix vs Potting Soil</h2>

  <p>
    Potting soil is designed for established plants.
  </p>

  <p>
    It often contains:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Compost</li>
    <li>Fertilizer</li>
    <li>Larger organic particles</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    While potting soil is suitable for potting up seedlings later,
    it may be too coarse or nutrient-rich for germination.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Moisture Balance Is Critical</h2>

  <p>
    Seedlings need consistent moisture — not saturated soil.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good seed starting mix:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Absorbs water evenly</li>
    <li>Drains excess moisture</li>
    <li>Prevents surface crusting</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even with the correct mix, overwatering can still cause problems.
    Airflow helps reduce excess surface moisture once seedlings emerge.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Do Seeds Need Fertilizer in the Mix?</h2>

  <p>
    Most seeds contain enough stored energy for initial growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fertilizer is usually unnecessary during germination and the first set of leaves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Excess nutrients too early can stress young roots.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Short-Season Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    In colder northern regions across the U.S. and comparable Canadian climates,
    seeds are often started during periods of lower light and cooler indoor temperatures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under these conditions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Soil dries more slowly.</li>
    <li>Air circulation may be limited.</li>
    <li>Disease pressure increases if moisture lingers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    A well-draining mix becomes especially important when indoor conditions are less than ideal.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Can You Make Your Own Seed Starting Mix?</h2>

  <p>
    Some gardeners blend peat or coir with perlite or vermiculite to create a custom mix.
  </p>

  <p>
    The key characteristics remain the same:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Fine texture</li>
    <li>Good aeration</li>
    <li>Consistent moisture retention</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Whether store-bought or homemade, structure matters more than brand.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can I reuse seed starting mix?</summary>
    <p>
      Reusing mix increases disease risk unless it is sterilized properly.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is compost okay for starting seeds?</summary>
    <p>
      Compost is better suited for potting up established seedlings.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do cool-season crops need special mix?</summary>
    <p>
      All seedlings benefit from loose, well-draining medium during germination.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does location (U.S. vs Canada) matter?</summary>
    <p>
      Indoor moisture control matters more than geography.
