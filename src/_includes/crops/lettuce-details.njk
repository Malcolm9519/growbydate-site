  <h2>About Lettuce</h2>

  <p class="tagline">
    Fast cool-season greens—best when timed to avoid heat.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Lettuce thrives in cool weather and struggles in sustained heat.</strong>
    In short growing seasons, success depends on planting early enough to mature before summer warmth triggers bolting. Fall plantings are often even more reliable because temperatures gradually decline.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because lettuce tolerates light frost, it fits naturally into frost-based schedules across northern U.S. and comparable Canadian climates.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 55–70°F (13–21°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 40°F (4°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress / bolting risk:</strong> Above 75–80°F (24–27°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Light frost tolerance:</strong> 28–32°F (-2 to 0°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Hard freeze damage:</strong> Below 25°F (-4°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Lettuce tolerates light frost once established. A freeze at 32°F (0°C) is usually not harmful, though repeated hard freezes can damage tender leaves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Heat is the primary limitation. When temperatures rise above 75–80°F (24–27°C), lettuce often bolts, sending up a flower stalk and turning bitter.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>

  <p>
    In short seasons, lettuce is usually direct sown or transplanted early in spring. Because it matures quickly, it can be planted multiple times.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spring crop:</strong> Sow 4–6 weeks before your average last frost, or transplant 2–3 weeks before last frost.</li>
    <li><strong>Succession planting:</strong> Sow every 2–3 weeks for steady harvest.</li>
    <li><strong>Fall crop:</strong> Sow 6–8 weeks before first frost so plants mature as temperatures cool.</li>
  </ul>

    Lettuce can survive light frost, but growth slows sharply in cold soil. Plan sowing so plants establish before extreme temperatures.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Lettuce can be direct sown or started indoors. Indoor starts help you get earlier harvest in short seasons and allow better spacing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Germination occurs best in cool soil (40–70°F / 4–21°C). High soil temperatures above about 75°F (24°C) can reduce germination rates.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    Lettuce prefers full sun in cool weather and partial shade during warmer periods.
    Even moisture is critical—dry soil combined with heat accelerates bolting and bitterness.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short seasons, prioritize steady watering and spacing that allows airflow without overcrowding.
  </p>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Variety choice affects heat tolerance and maturity timing:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Leaf lettuce:</strong> Fastest harvest; best for succession planting</li>
    <li><strong>Romaine:</strong> Upright growth; moderate maturity time</li>
    <li><strong>Butterhead:</strong> Tender texture; moderate heat tolerance</li>
    <li><strong>Crisphead:</strong> Longer maturity; better suited to stable cool climates</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fine muted">
    For short seasons, leaf and romaine types are often the most reliable.
  </p>

  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Lettuce handles light frost well and can continue producing through mild freezes.
    However, extended temperatures below 25°F (-4°C) can damage leaves and reduce quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harvest mature heads before prolonged hard freezes. If a brief frost is forecast, light row cover can protect plants and extend the season.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Can lettuce survive frost?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Established lettuce tolerates light frost down to about 28–32°F (-2 to 0°C).
  </p>

  <h3>Why did my lettuce bolt?</h3>
  <p>
    Temperatures above 75–80°F (24–27°C), long daylight hours, or uneven watering often trigger bolting.
  </p>

  <h3>Is lettuce better in spring or fall?</h3>
  <p>
    Both work well in cold climates, but fall plantings often produce sweeter, more consistent harvests as temperatures cool.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    Lettuce is a frost-tolerant cool-season crop that grows quickly in moderate temperatures.
    Plant early, use succession sowing, and avoid peak heat to maintain tender, high-quality leaves in short growing seasons.
