  <h2>Short Season Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Success is mostly about timing: plant early, then plant again as summer heat fades.</li>
    <li>Keep soil consistently moist—dry spells speed up bolting.</li>
    <li>If days turn hot quickly, use light shade (even a cloth) to stretch the harvest window.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Lettuce often does better in late summer and early fall than mid-summer.
    Use your first frost date to back-calculate a final sowing window.
