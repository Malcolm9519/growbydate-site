  <h2>About Radishes</h2>
  <p>
    Radishes are a fast-maturing cool-season root crop. In short seasons, they’re one of the easiest crops to time because
    days-to-maturity is short and cool weather improves quality.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 50–65°F (10–18°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress:</strong> Above 75°F (24°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 35°F (2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Heat pushes radishes toward pithy texture and stronger flavor; frost-first timing keeps growth in the cool range.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    Radishes can be sown before last frost as soon as soil is workable. Because maturity is fast, they also fit cleanly into late-summer sowing
    when planned backward from first frost.

<section class="card">
  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Radishes are direct sown. Transplanting is not typical because roots deform when disturbed and the crop matures quickly.
  </p>

  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun to partial shade</li>
    <li>Loose soil for clean root shape</li>
    <li>Even moisture to reduce cracking and stress</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spring types (≈20–30 days):</strong> Best in cool conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>Fall types (≈25–35 days):</strong> Often handle cooling nights better.</li>
    <li><strong>Harvest timing:</strong> Oversized roots often become pithy—harvest is part of the plan.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Light frost is usually survivable, but hard freezes near 32°F (0°C) can damage foliage and stop growth. Plan fall sowing so most growth happens before sustained cold nights.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can radishes handle frost?</summary>
    <p>Light frost is usually fine. Hard freezes at 32°F (0°C) or lower can damage foliage and stop growth.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why are radishes spicy or pithy?</summary>
    <p>Heat and uneven moisture cause stress. Frost-first timing keeps growth in cooler conditions.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do radishes need indoor starts?</summary>
    <p>No. They’re direct sown because maturity is fast and roots dislike disturbance.</p>
