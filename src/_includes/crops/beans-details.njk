  <h2>About Beans</h2>

  <p class="tagline">
    Direct-sow warm-season crop—wait for soil warmth, not just the calendar.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Beans are highly frost-sensitive and dislike cold soil.</strong>
    In short growing seasons, success depends less on starting early and more on waiting for warm conditions. Planting too soon into cool soil often results in slow germination, rot, or stalled growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beans grow quickly once temperatures are consistently warm, making them well-suited to northern U.S. and comparable Canadian climates—provided you time planting around soil warmth rather than last frost alone.
  </p>

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 70–85°F (21–29°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 60°F (16°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Germination minimum:</strong> About 55°F (13°C) soil temperature</li>
    <li><strong>Stress threshold:</strong> Below 50°F (10°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Beans do not tolerate frost at any stage. A light freeze at 32°F (0°C) can kill seedlings or severely damage established plants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cold soil is the more common issue in short seasons. Even if air temperatures are mild, soil below 55–60°F (13–16°C) slows germination and increases seed rot risk.
  </p>

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>

  <p>
    Unlike cool-season crops, beans should be planted <strong>after</strong> last frost—once soil has warmed and nights stay consistently above 50°F (10°C).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spring planting:</strong> Direct sow 1–3 weeks after your average last frost, depending on soil warmth.</li>
    <li><strong>Successive sowing:</strong> Plant every 2–3 weeks for staggered harvest.</li>
    <li><strong>Fall timing:</strong> Final sowing should occur early enough to mature before first frost.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fine muted">
    In cold climates, waiting an extra week for warmer soil often produces stronger plants and earlier harvest than rushing to plant right after last frost.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Beans are typically direct sown. They grow quickly and dislike root disturbance.
    Indoor starting is rarely necessary and can result in transplant shock.
  </p>

  <p>
    For fastest germination, aim for soil temperatures above 60°F (16°C).
    If early-season soil remains cold, consider raised beds or dark mulch to accelerate warming.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    Beans prefer full sun and well-drained soil. Consistent moisture supports steady pod production, but overly wet soil—especially when cool—can lead to root problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short seasons, the most important factor is warmth. Choose the sunniest, warmest part of your garden for earliest harvest.
  </p>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    In colder climates, prioritize shorter maturity varieties (50–60 days) to ensure harvest before fall frost.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bush beans:</strong> Compact, faster harvest, ideal for short seasons</li>
    <li><strong>Pole beans:</strong> Longer harvest window but slightly later maturity</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fine muted">
    Bush beans are often the most reliable choice where summers are shorter or nights cool quickly in late season.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Beans are highly frost-sensitive. Even a light freeze can end production.
    As first frost approaches, harvest remaining pods—even immature ones—before temperatures drop to freezing.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a brief light frost is forecast, temporary row cover may protect plants for a short window, but prolonged cold will end the season.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Can beans survive frost?</h3>
  <p>
    No. Beans are frost-sensitive and can be damaged or killed at 32°F (0°C).
  </p>

  <h3>Why didn’t my beans germinate?</h3>
  <p>
    Soil that is too cold (below about 55°F / 13°C) often leads to poor germination or seed rot.
  </p>

  <h3>Is it better to plant beans early or wait?</h3>
  <p>
    In short seasons, waiting for warm soil usually produces faster growth and earlier harvest than planting into cold conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    Beans are a warm-season, frost-sensitive crop that depend on soil warmth more than calendar timing.
    Wait until soil temperatures rise, plant in full sun, and choose shorter-maturity varieties to ensure harvest before fall frost.
