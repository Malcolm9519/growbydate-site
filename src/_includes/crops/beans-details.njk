  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Beans are a warm-season crop and do best when soil is consistently warm. In short growing seasons, variety choice affects reliability.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bush beans:</strong> Often mature faster and more predictably than pole beans in short seasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Pole beans:</strong> Higher total yield potential, but require more time and sustained warmth.</li>
    <li><strong>Days to maturity:</strong> Choose earlier varieties if your frost-free window is tight.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cold starts slow germination and can lead to uneven stands, especially if nights remain cool.

  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Beans are frost-sensitive and can be damaged by light frost. A hard freeze ends the season.
  </p>

  <p>
    As nighttime temperatures approach 32°F (0°C):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Harvest mature pods promptly.</li>
    <li>Pick remaining pods before a hard freeze, even if slightly under-sized.</li>
    <li>Avoid late sowings that won’t reach maturity before your first fall frost risk increases.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short-season climates, frost timing often determines whether a late planting finishes.
