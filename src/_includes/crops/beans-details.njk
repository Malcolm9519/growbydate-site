  <h2>Short Season Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wait for warm soil—cold starts lead to slow growth and uneven stands.</li>
    <li>Bush beans are often simpler than pole beans in short seasons.</li>
    <li>For steady harvest, sow a second round a couple weeks after the first.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Beans are frost-sensitive. If fall cool-down arrives early where you are, aim for earlier varieties and avoid late sowings that won’t finish.
