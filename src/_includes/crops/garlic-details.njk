  <h2>About Garlic</h2>
  <p>
    Garlic is typically planted in fall and harvested the following summer. It’s frost-first in timing, but it’s not a single-season
    “mature before first frost” crop like greens or roots.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 50–75°F (10–24°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress:</strong> Above 85°F (29°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 20–25°F (-6–-4°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower (foliage can be damaged; established plants survive deeper cold)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Garlic is cold-hardy once established. The main fall risk is failing to establish roots before sustained freezing.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    Garlic is planted ahead of winter so it can root before the ground freezes. Frost-first planning uses first frost and freeze-up
    as the seasonal anchors, but harvest is the following summer.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you plant too early, top growth can be excessive before winter. If you plant too late, cloves may not root well before freeze-up.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Garlic is planted from cloves, not started indoors from seed in typical home gardening. The planning decision is outdoor planting timing.

  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun</li>
    <li>Well-drained soil (standing water increases winter loss risk)</li>
    <li>Loose soil for bulb expansion in summer</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hardneck:</strong> common choice for cold climates; strong winter performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Softneck:</strong> often stores longer; cold performance varies by type and site.</li>
    <li><strong>Local adaptation:</strong> varieties proven in similar frost patterns perform more reliably.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Light frost is not the main concern for garlic. The key fall milestone is establishing roots before sustained freezing.
    Once established, garlic survives winter conditions that would kill most crops.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Does garlic survive winter?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Once established, garlic is cold-hardy and can handle repeated frosts. A freeze at 32°F (0°C) is not a kill point for established plants.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why doesn’t garlic fit a first-frost maturity cutoff?</summary>
    <p>Because garlic is planted in fall and harvested the next summer. Its timeline is multi-season, not “mature before first frost.”</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is garlic started indoors?</summary>
    <p>No. It’s planted outdoors as cloves.</p>
