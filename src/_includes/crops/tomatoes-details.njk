  <h2>About Tomatoes</h2>

  <p>
    Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) are tender annuals grown for fresh eating,
    cooking, preserving, and sauce production.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are highly productive when planted at the correct time but are extremely sensitive to frost and prolonged cool conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 70–85°F (21–29°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 60°F (16°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Flower drop risk:</strong> Repeated nights below 55°F (13°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 40°F (4°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even when frost does not occur, cool nights can delay fruit development.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>

  <p>
    Tomatoes must be planted after your average last spring frost date,
    once nighttime temperatures remain consistently above 50°F (10°C).
  </p>

  <p>
    In cold northern climates across the U.S. and comparable Canadian regions,
    transplanting often occurs in late May or early June.
  </p>

  <p>
    Early planting into cold soil often results in stalled growth.
  </p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Tomato seeds are typically started indoors 6–8 weeks before the last frost date.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Provide strong light immediately after germination.</li>
    <li>Maintain indoor temperatures around 70–75°F (21–24°C).</li>
    <li>Avoid starting too early to prevent leggy growth.</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Full sun (6–8+ hours daily)</li>
    <li>Well-drained soil</li>
    <li>Soil temperature near 60°F (16°C) at transplant</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cold, saturated soil delays root establishment.
  </p>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Variety selection affects success in short growing seasons.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Determinate varieties:</strong> Compact plants, concentrated harvest.</li>
    <li><strong>Indeterminate varieties:</strong> Continuous production until frost.</li>
    <li><strong>Early-maturing varieties (55–70 days):</strong> Best for short seasons.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Large heirloom varieties may require extended warm conditions.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Tomatoes are typically killed by the first hard frost of fall.
  </p>

  <p>
    As nighttime temperatures approach 32°F (0°C):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Harvest mature fruit.</li>
    <li>Cover plants temporarily if mild frost is forecast.</li>
    <li>Remove green fruit before a hard freeze.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In short-season climates, frost timing often determines total yield.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can tomatoes survive light frost?</summary>
    <p>
      No. Even light frost can damage leaves and growing points.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is 45°F (7°C) too cold for tomatoes?</summary>
    <p>
      Tomatoes survive but growth slows noticeably.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>When should tomatoes be transplanted outdoors?</summary>
    <p>
      After the last frost date and when nighttime lows remain above 50°F (10°C).
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does this apply to Canadian climates?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Frost-based timing works anywhere with seasonal freezing.
