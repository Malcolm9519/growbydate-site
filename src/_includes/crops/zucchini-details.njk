  <h2>About Zucchini</h2>

  <p class="tagline">
    Fast-growing warm-season squash that depends on warm soil and frost-free conditions.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Zucchini is frost-sensitive and performs best in steady warmth.</strong>
    In short growing seasons, planting too early into cool soil slows growth and delays harvest. Once conditions are warm, plants grow rapidly and can produce heavily before fall frost.
  </p>

  <p>
    In northern U.S. and comparable Canadian climates, timing around soil temperature—not just last frost date—is the key factor for reliable production.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 70–85°F (21–29°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 60°F (16°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Stress threshold:</strong> Below 55°F (13°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Soil temperature for planting:</strong> At least 60°F (16°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Zucchini does not tolerate frost. Even a brief freeze at 32°F (0°C) can severely damage or kill plants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cool nights below 55°F (13°C) slow early growth and reduce early fruit set. Warm soil and stable nighttime temperatures are essential for strong establishment.
  </p>

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>

  <p>
    Zucchini should be planted after all danger of frost has passed and soil has warmed adequately.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Direct sow:</strong> 1–3 weeks after average last frost once soil reaches 60°F (16°C).</li>
    <li><strong>Indoor start (optional):</strong> Start 3–4 weeks before transplanting if you can provide consistent warmth.</li>
    <li><strong>Final planting window:</strong> Ensure enough growing time before first fall frost ends production.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Use the <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a> to calculate planting timing based on your frost dates.
  </p>

  <p class="fine muted">
    In cold climates, delaying planting slightly for warmer soil often results in earlier harvest than planting into marginal conditions.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Zucchini is usually direct sown. It germinates quickly in warm soil and dislikes root disturbance.
  </p>

  <p>
    If starting indoors, use larger cells and transplant carefully before roots become crowded. Maintain soil temperatures around 70–80°F (21–27°C) for strong germination.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    Zucchini prefers full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil.
    In short seasons, warmth and light exposure matter more than early heavy feeding.
  </p>

  <p>
    Raised beds or mounded rows warm faster in spring and can improve early-season growth in cold regions.
  </p>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Most zucchini varieties mature quickly (45–60 days), but choosing early types improves reliability in short seasons.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Compact bush types:</strong> Ideal for small gardens and fast maturity</li>
    <li><strong>Traditional open-pollinated:</strong> Reliable and consistent</li>
    <li><strong>Hybrid varieties:</strong> Often improved vigor and uniformity</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fine muted">
    Early maturity reduces the risk of losing production to early fall frost.
  </p>
</section>

  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Zucchini production typically ends with the first freeze.
    Even a light frost can collapse leaves and stop fruit development.
  </p>

  <p>
    As frost approaches, harvest all usable fruit—small zucchini are edible and store briefly. Temporary row cover can protect against very light frost but will not withstand sustained freezing.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Can zucchini survive frost?</h3>
  <p>
    No. Zucchini plants are killed by freezing temperatures at or below 32°F (0°C).
  </p>

  <h3>Why are my zucchini plants growing slowly?</h3>
  <p>
    Cool soil or nighttime temperatures below 60°F (16°C) commonly slow early growth and delay fruit set.
  </p>

  <h3>Is it better to start zucchini indoors?</h3>
  <p>
    Direct sowing into warm soil is usually most reliable. Indoor starts are helpful only if warmth is consistent and transplant shock is minimized.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    Zucchini is a fast, productive warm-season crop that depends on warm soil and frost-free conditions.
    Wait for consistent warmth, choose early varieties, and harvest steadily before fall frost ends the season.
