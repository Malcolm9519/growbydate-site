  <h2>About Peppers</h2>
 <p class="tagline">
    Heat-loving crop highly sensitive to cold nights.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Peppers require consistently warm temperatures and are more sensitive to cold than tomatoes.</strong>
    Growth slows below 60°F (16°C), and prolonged exposure below 50°F (10°C) can permanently stunt plants.

    to calculate your indoor seed-start and transplant timing based on your local frost dates.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 75–85°F (24–29°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 65°F (18°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Stress likely:</strong> 50–55°F (10–13°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold injury risk:</strong> Around 40°F (4°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Peppers are especially sensitive to repeated cool nights, even without frost.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Transplant Window</h2>

  <p>
    Peppers should be transplanted after your average last spring frost,
    once nighttime lows consistently remain above 55°F (13°C).
  </p>

  <p>
    In colder northern climates across the U.S. and comparable Canadian regions,
    this often means waiting one to two weeks after tomato transplant timing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Planting too early into cool soil can permanently stunt growth.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Peppers typically require 8–10 weeks indoors before transplanting.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Maintain soil temperatures near 75–85°F (24–29°C) for germination.</li>
    <li>Provide strong light immediately after sprouting.</li>
    <li>Avoid early transplant into cool conditions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Because peppers grow slowly in cool weather,
    proper indoor timing is especially important.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Full sun exposure</li>
    <li>Well-drained soil</li>
    <li>Soil temperatures above 65°F (18°C) at transplant</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cool, wet soil delays root establishment and reduces early yield.

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Variety selection significantly affects success in shorter seasons.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Early-maturing sweet peppers:</strong> 60–70 days</li>
    <li><strong>Hot peppers:</strong> Often mature faster than large bell types</li>
    <li><strong>Large bell varieties:</strong> Require sustained heat</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In climates with short frost-free windows, early varieties increase reliability.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Peppers are killed by freezing temperatures.
  </p>

  <p>
    As nighttime lows approach 32°F (0°C):
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Harvest mature fruit.</li>
    <li>Remove near-mature peppers before a hard freeze.</li>
    <li>Cover plants temporarily if mild frost is forecast.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even brief frost can cause extensive leaf damage.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Are peppers more cold-sensitive than tomatoes?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Peppers require warmer soil and nighttime temperatures for strong growth.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Can peppers survive 45°F (7°C)?</summary>
    <p>
      They survive but growth slows significantly.
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>When should peppers be transplanted outdoors?</summary>
    <p>
      After the last frost date and once nighttime lows consistently exceed 55°F (13°C).
    </p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Does this apply to Canadian climates?</summary>
    <p>
      Yes. Frost-based timing applies across cold northern regions.
