<h2>Best Varieties for Short Seasons</h2>
<p>
        Look for early-maturing varieties and smaller fruit types. In cool summers,
        large thick-walled peppers can finish late.
      </p>
<ul>
<li>Early bell or “short-season” bell varieties</li>
<li>Thin-walled frying peppers for faster ripening</li>
<li>Hot peppers often finish more reliably than large bells</li>
</ul>

        Tip: seed packets vary. Use the listed days to maturity as a planning estimate, not a guarantee.

<h2>Common Short-Season Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Starting too late.</strong> Peppers don’t “catch up” easily once behind.</li>
<li><strong>Transplanting into cold soil.</strong> Growth stalls hard in cool conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Underheating seedlings.</strong> Warm germination and bright light prevent weak starts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fall Planning Notes</h2>
<p>
        Peppers are frost sensitive, and ripening slows in late season. If frost risk is close,
        focus on fruit set and ripening rather than new flowers.
      </p>
<ul>
<li>Remove late blossoms 4–6 weeks before first frost</li>
<li>Use protection early in fall to extend ripening</li>
<li>Harvest mature green fruit before frost if needed</li>
</ul>
