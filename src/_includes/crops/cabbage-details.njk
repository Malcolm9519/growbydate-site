  <h2>About Cabbage</h2>

  <p class="tagline">
    A cool-season staple that rewards early timing and steady growth.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Cabbage thrives in cool weather and tolerates light frost.</strong>
    In short seasons, the key is giving it enough time to size up before heat arrives. Start indoors early, transplant on schedule, and aim for consistent growth—delays often lead to smaller heads or heat stress.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cabbage works well across cold-climate regions in both the northern U.S. and comparable Canadian areas because it’s frost-aware by nature and doesn’t need warm nights to establish.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 55–70°F (13–21°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress / bolting risk:</strong> Above 80°F (27°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Light frost tolerance:</strong> 26–30°F (-3 to -1°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Hard freeze damage:</strong> Below 20–25°F (-6 to -4°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Established cabbage handles light freezes well, especially after hardening off outdoors. A brief freeze at 32°F (0°C) is usually not damaging.
    The bigger risk is heat: warm spells can stall head formation or push plants toward bolting, especially if growth was slowed earlier by stress.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>

  <p>
    In short growing seasons, cabbage is usually grown from transplants. Start seeds indoors so plants are ready to go outside early—cabbage can handle cool conditions that would stall warm-season crops.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spring crop:</strong> Start indoors about 8–10 weeks before last frost, then transplant 2–4 weeks before last frost.</li>
    <li><strong>Fall crop:</strong> Start or sow so plants have time to form heads before sustained freezing. Fall cabbage often performs well because temperatures cool gradually.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

    Cabbage can survive frost, but it still needs time and steady temperatures to build a full head. Timing is about giving it runway before heat or deep cold.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Start cabbage indoors under strong light. Keep seedlings around 60–70°F (16–21°C) for steady growth, then harden off gradually before transplanting.
    Cabbage transplants are resilient and usually handle cool spring planting well once hardened.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transplant before plants become oversized in their cells. Stalled or root-bound seedlings can struggle to resume uniform growth outdoors.
  </p>

  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    Cabbage prefers full sun and fertile, evenly moist soil. Consistent moisture supports steady leaf production and head formation.
    Irregular watering (especially during warm spells) increases stress and can lead to slower head development.
  </p>

  <p>
    In cold climates, the practical site priority is wind protection early in the season. Cold wind can slow seedlings even when temperatures are technically acceptable.

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    In short seasons, variety choice is mostly about maturity time and harvest timing:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Early cabbage:</strong> Faster heading (often best for short springs)</li>
    <li><strong>Main-season cabbage:</strong> Larger heads but longer maturity</li>
    <li><strong>Storage cabbage:</strong> Longer season; best where you can reliably grow into fall</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fine muted">
    If your summers heat up quickly, prioritize early varieties to avoid head formation during peak heat.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Cabbage tolerates light frost well and often improves in flavor as temperatures cool.
    The main fall risk is extended hard freezes below about 20–25°F (-6 to -4°C), which can damage outer leaves and compromise head quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    If deep cold is approaching, harvest firm heads and store them cool. Leaving mature heads in the garden through repeated hard freezes can reduce quality.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Can cabbage survive frost?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Established cabbage commonly tolerates light frost and brief freezes down to roughly 26–30°F (-3 to -1°C).
  </p>

  <h3>Why didn’t my cabbage form a head?</h3>
  <p>
    Head formation often fails when plants experience uneven growth—stress from heat, drought, or long stalls early in development can prevent tight heading.
  </p>

  <h3>Is cabbage better in spring or fall?</h3>
  <p>
    Both can work in cold climates. Spring cabbage relies on early transplanting to beat heat, while fall cabbage often heads more consistently in cooling temperatures.

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    Cabbage is a frost-tolerant cool-season crop that thrives with early starts and steady growth.
    Start indoors, transplant before last frost, and aim for head formation in cool temperatures—heat and delays are the most common reasons for poor results in short seasons.
