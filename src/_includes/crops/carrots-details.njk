  <h2>About Carrots</h2>
  <p>
    This page is a frost-first reference for timing carrots in short growing seasons. Use your frost dates as anchors,
    then adjust based on temperature thresholds and how quickly growth slows in cool nights.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 60–70°F (16–21°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Stress threshold:</strong> Above 80°F (27°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 35°F (2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    Plan spring timing from your <strong>last frost</strong>. Cool-season crops can often be planted earlier than warm-season crops,
    but cold soil slows germination and early growth. Warm-season crops should only be planted after frost risk and cold nights decline.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plan fall timing from your <strong>first frost</strong>. Count backward using days to maturity, then add practical buffer for slower growth
    as nights cool into the low 40s°F (single digits °C).

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Use the seed-start planner for indoor start and transplant windows when applicable. If this crop is typically direct sown,
    timing is still frost-first—start when soil is workable and temperatures support steady growth.
  </p>

  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun (or light shade for leafy crops in warmer spells)</li>
    <li>Well-drained soil to avoid cold, waterlogged roots</li>
    <li>Consistent moisture during establishment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Faster varieties:</strong> improve reliability in short seasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Slower varieties:</strong> require earlier planting and a wider frost window.</li>
    <li><strong>Quality is temperature-driven:</strong> frost-first timing is the main control.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    As first frost approaches, growth rate matters as much as frost tolerance. Even if foliage survives light frost, plants may stop sizing up when
    nights stay cold. When temperatures approach 32°F (0°C), protect or harvest depending on the crop.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>What temperature stops growth for this crop?</summary>
    <p>Expect slow growth below the listed slow-growth threshold, and rapid slowdown as nights cool into the low 40s°F (single digits °C).</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is frost tolerance the same as “keeps growing”?</summary>
    <p>No. A crop may survive light frost, but still stop growing when temperatures are too cold for steady development.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>How should I use frost dates?</summary>
    <p>Use last frost for spring planting windows and first frost for fall cutoffs, then adjust based on temperature thresholds.</p>
  </details>
