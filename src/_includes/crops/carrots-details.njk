  <h2>About Carrots</h2>
  <p>
    Carrots are a direct-sown root crop that develops best in cool weather. In short seasons, your main lever is timing:
    sow early when soil is workable, then use days-to-maturity to make sure roots size up before fall cool-down slows growth.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 60–70°F (16–21°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress:</strong> Above 80°F (27°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 35°F (2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Established roots tolerate cool weather well, but hard freezes can damage tops and eventually affect roots if prolonged.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    Carrots are usually sown from just before your average last frost through early spring. Early sowing matters because
    germination and early growth are slower in cold soil.
  </p>
  <p>
    For fall timing, count backward from first frost using days to maturity. Expect growth to slow once nights trend into the low 40s°F (single digits °C).

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Carrots are not typically started indoors—roots fork or deform when disturbed. Direct sowing is the standard approach.

  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun to light shade</li>
    <li>Loose, stone-free soil for straight roots</li>
    <li>Even moisture during germination (dry crusts reduce emergence)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Early types (≈60–70 days):</strong> Best fit for short seasons and fall timing.</li>
    <li><strong>Main-season types (≈70–80 days):</strong> Reliable when planted early enough.</li>
    <li><strong>Baby harvest:</strong> A practical fallback when you’re tight on time.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Light frost usually doesn’t end harvest, but hard freezes near 32°F (0°C) can cause damage. Harvest or protect if hard freezing is expected.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can carrots tolerate frost?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Established carrots tolerate light frost, but hard freezes at 32°F (0°C) or lower can damage tops and halt growth.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why do carrots take so long to emerge in spring?</summary>
    <p>Cold soil slows germination. Sowing when soil is workable is the key decision point in short seasons.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do I need to start carrots indoors?</summary>
    <p>No. Direct sowing is standard because carrots dislike root disturbance.</p>
