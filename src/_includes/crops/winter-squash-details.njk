  <h2>About Winter Squash</h2>
  <p>
    Winter squash is a tender warm-season crop with a long maturity window. In short seasons, it’s a planning challenge:
    you must wait for warm soil after last frost, then still finish fruit before first frost ends the season.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 70–90°F (21–32°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 60°F (16°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress:</strong> Above 95°F (35°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Cold soil and cold nights stall early growth. Frost-first timing keeps planting after last frost and focuses on finishing before fall freeze.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    Plant winter squash after last frost when soil has warmed. Warm-season crops need warm nights for steady growth—not just a frost-free date.
  </p>
  <p>
    For fall planning, first frost is the hard stop. If your days-to-maturity is close to your frost window, choose faster varieties or plan protection.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Indoor starts can help in short seasons, but don’t start too early. Squash grows quickly and can become stressed if held indoors too long.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Indoor start temps:</strong> ~70–80°F (21–27°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Transplant goal:</strong> healthy young plants, not rootbound starts</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun</li>
    <li>Well-drained soil that warms quickly</li>
    <li>Space for vines (or compact varieties for small spaces)</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fast maturity (≈80–90 days):</strong> best fit for short seasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Long maturity (≈95–110 days):</strong> requires a strong start and consistent warmth.</li>
    <li><strong>Earlier fruit set:</strong> improves odds of full maturity before frost.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Winter squash is killed by frost. When nights approach 32°F (0°C), unprotected vines can be damaged quickly.
    Harvest mature fruit before hard freeze if frost is near.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can winter squash survive frost?</summary>
    <p>No. Winter squash is frost-tender; freezes at 32°F (0°C) or lower can kill vines.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I start winter squash indoors?</summary>
    <p>Optional. A short indoor start can help in short seasons, but timing matters so plants aren’t held indoors too long.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>What’s the biggest short-season risk?</summary>
    <p>Not enough time to mature before first frost. Days-to-maturity + first frost determines feasibility.</p>
