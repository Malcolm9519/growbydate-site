  <h2>About Beets</h2>
  <p>
    Beets are a cool-season root crop grown by direct sowing. In short seasons, reliable results come from early sowing and choosing varieties
    that can size up before fall cool-down slows growth.
  </p>

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 55–70°F (13–21°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress:</strong> Above 80°F (27°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 35°F (2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Beets handle cool conditions well, but hard freezes can damage foliage and shorten finishing time.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    Beets can be sown near last frost once soil is workable. In short seasons, earlier sowing helps because early growth is slower in cold soil.
  </p>
  <p>
    For fall beets, count backward from first frost using days to maturity, then expect slower root sizing as nights cool.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Beets are typically direct sown. Transplanting can work, but it often reduces root quality and consistency compared with undisturbed roots.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun to light shade</li>
    <li>Loose soil for even root shape</li>
    <li>Consistent moisture for uniform sizing</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fast varieties (≈50–60 days):</strong> Best fit for fall timing.</li>
    <li><strong>Main-season varieties (≈60–70 days):</strong> Reliable when sown early enough.</li>
    <li><strong>Greens:</strong> Leaf harvest is faster, but fall planning is root-driven if you want beets.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Light frost is often tolerable, but when temperatures approach 32°F (0°C), foliage damage becomes likely. Harvest or protect if hard freezing is forecast.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can beets tolerate frost?</summary>
    <p>Beets tolerate light frost, but freezes at 32°F (0°C) or lower can damage foliage and shorten finishing time.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do beets need warm soil to germinate?</summary>
    <p>No. They germinate in cool soil, but emergence is slower when soils are cold.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I start beets indoors?</summary>
    <p>Usually no. Direct sowing is more consistent for root quality.</p>
