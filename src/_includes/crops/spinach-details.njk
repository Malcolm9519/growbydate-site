  <h2>About Spinach</h2>

  <p class="tagline">
    Fast-growing cool-season greens that prefer cold over heat.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Spinach performs best in cool temperatures and struggles once heat arrives.</strong>
    In short growing seasons, timing matters more than fertilizing or variety choice. Plant early for spring harvest and again in late summer so plants mature into fall cooling rather than summer heat.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because spinach tolerates frost well, it fits naturally into frost-based planting schedules across northern U.S. and comparable Canadian climates.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 50–65°F (10–18°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 40°F (4°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress / bolting risk:</strong> Above 75°F (24°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Light frost tolerance:</strong> 25–28°F (-4 to -2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Hard freeze damage:</strong> Below 20°F (-6°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Spinach easily handles light frost once established. A freeze at 32°F (0°C) is rarely damaging.
    The real threat is heat. Extended warm weather quickly triggers bolting, causing leaves to become bitter and plants to flower.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>

  <p>
    In cold climates, spinach is usually direct sown rather than transplanted.
    Seeds germinate in cool soil and plants grow steadily in spring temperatures
