  <h2>About Cucumbers</h2>

  <p class="tagline">
    Warm-season vines that require steady heat and frost-free conditions.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Cucumbers are frost-sensitive and dislike cold soil.</strong>
    In short growing seasons, the key is waiting for consistent warmth before planting. Cold starts slow growth, increase disease risk, and delay harvest more than almost any other factor.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once established in warm soil, cucumbers grow rapidly and can produce heavily before fall cool-down—making timing critical in northern U.S. and comparable Canadian climates.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 70–85°F (21–29°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 60°F (16°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Stress threshold:</strong> Below 55°F (13°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Soil temperature for planting:</strong> At least 60°F (16°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Cucumbers do not tolerate frost at any stage. A light freeze at 32°F (0°C) will severely damage or kill plants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even without frost, cool nights below 55°F (13°C) can slow early growth. Warm soil and steady nighttime temperatures are more important than planting as soon as frost risk passes.
  </p>

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>

  <p>
    In short climates, cucumbers should be planted only after frost risk has passed and soil has warmed.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Direct sow:</strong> 1–3 weeks after your average last frost, once soil temperatures reach 60°F (16°C).</li>
    <li><strong>Indoor start (optional):</strong> Start 3–4 weeks before transplanting if you can provide consistent warmth.</li>
    <li><strong>Final planting window:</strong> Ensure enough time for fruit set and harvest before first fall frost.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Use the <a href="/tools/seed-start-planner/">Seed Starting Planner</a> to align your planting window with your local frost dates.
  </p>

  <p class="fine muted">
    In cold regions, planting too early into cool soil often results in slower harvest than waiting one additional warm week.
  </p>

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Cucumbers are typically direct sown, but short-season growers sometimes start them indoors to gain time.
    If starting indoors, use larger cells and transplant before roots become crowded.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maintain soil temperatures around 70–80°F (21–27°C) for strong germination. Cold seed-starting conditions reduce vigor.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    Cucumbers require full sun and consistently moist, well-drained soil.
    Warmth and light exposure are more important than heavy fertilization in short seasons.
  </p>

  <p>
    Raised beds or mounded rows warm faster in spring and can improve early growth in cold climates.
  </p>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    In short seasons, select early-maturing varieties (45–60 days).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pickling types:</strong> Often earlier and more compact</li>
    <li><strong>Slicing types:</strong> Larger fruit; slightly longer maturity</li>
    <li><strong>Parthenocarpic varieties:</strong> Set fruit without pollination—helpful in cool or inconsistent weather</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fine muted">
    Faster varieties reduce the risk of losing harvest to early fall frost.
  </p>

  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Cucumbers are extremely frost-sensitive. A single freeze typically ends production.
  </p>

  <p>
    As first frost approaches, harvest remaining fruit—even smaller cucumbers—before temperatures drop to freezing.
    Temporary row cover can provide brief protection from light frost but will not protect against sustained cold.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Can cucumbers survive frost?</h3>
  <p>
    No. Cucumbers are killed by temperatures at or below 32°F (0°C).
  </p>

  <h3>Why are my cucumbers growing slowly?</h3>
  <p>
    Cool soil or nighttime temperatures below 60°F (16°C) commonly slow early growth.
  </p>

  <h3>Is it better to direct sow or transplant cucumbers?</h3>
  <p>
    Direct sowing into warm soil is usually most reliable. Indoor starts help only if warmth can be maintained consistently.

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    Cucumbers are frost-sensitive warm-season vines that depend on warm soil and steady nighttime temperatures.
    Wait for consistent warmth, choose early varieties, and harvest before fall frost to maximize success in short growing seasons.
