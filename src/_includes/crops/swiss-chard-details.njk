  <h2>About Swiss Chard</h2>
  <p>
    Swiss chard is a durable leafy crop that performs well in cool conditions and stays productive across a wide temperature range.
    In short seasons, it’s a reliable bridge crop from spring through fall.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 55–75°F (13–24°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress:</strong> Above 85°F (29°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 35°F (2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Chard tolerates cool nights better than many greens, but hard freezes can damage leaves.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    Swiss chard can be started early and transplanted around last frost, including slightly before last frost when weather is stable.
    Direct sowing also works once soil is workable.
  </p>
  <p>
    For fall planning, count backward from first frost using days to maturity, then expect slower growth as nights cool.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Chard can be started indoors for earlier harvest and more predictable establishment in short seasons. Direct sowing is also common when soil is workable.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun to partial shade</li>
    <li>Well-drained soil (cold, wet soil slows establishment)</li>
    <li>Even moisture supports steady leaf production</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Standard chard:</strong> dependable leaf production across the season.</li>
    <li><strong>Colored stems:</strong> same timing, mostly a harvest preference.</li>
    <li><strong>Baby harvest:</strong> useful when fall timing is tight.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Chard handles cool fall conditions, but as temperatures approach 32°F (0°C), leaf damage becomes likely. Harvest or protect if hard freezes are forecast.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can Swiss chard survive frost?</summary>
    <p>It tolerates light frost, but freezes at 32°F (0°C) or lower can damage leaves.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Is chard a cool-season or warm-season crop?</summary>
    <p>Cool-season. It performs well in cool weather and is more tolerant than many greens.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should I start chard indoors?</summary>
    <p>Optional. Indoor starts help in short seasons; direct sowing also works when soil is workable.</p>
