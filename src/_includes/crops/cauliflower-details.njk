  <h2>About Cauliflower</h2>
  <p>
    Cauliflower is a cool-season brassica with tighter timing requirements than many crops. In short seasons, indoor starts and on-time transplanting
    are the most reliable path to quality heads.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 60–70°F (16–21°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 50°F (10°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress:</strong> Above 80°F (27°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 35°F (2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Temperature swings can affect head quality. Frost-first timing aims for steady cool growth and avoids sustained heat.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    Plan cauliflower around last frost with a clear indoor start and transplant window. In short seasons, the goal is to establish plants early
    so heads form before sustained heat disrupts quality.
  </p>
  <p>
    For fall timing, count backward from first frost using days to maturity plus buffer. Fall success depends on finishing before nights are consistently cold.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Indoor starts improve reliability in short seasons. Start on time so seedlings are ready to transplant into cool spring weather without becoming overgrown.

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun</li>
    <li>Well-drained soil (cold wet soil delays establishment)</li>
    <li>Even moisture supports steady growth and head formation</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Early types (≈60–75 days):</strong> best fit for short seasons and fall timing.</li>
    <li><strong>Midseason types (≈75–100 days):</strong> require earlier transplant timing.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat sensitivity:</strong> timing is prevention when warm stretches hit.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Cauliflower tolerates light frost, but hard freezes at 32°F (0°C) can damage developing heads.
    If you are near cutoff, choose the fastest varieties or plan protection.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can cauliflower survive frost?</summary>
    <p>Light frost is often tolerable, but freezes at 32°F (0°C) can damage heads and foliage.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why is cauliflower timing so strict?</summary>
    <p>Head formation is sensitive to temperature swings. Frost-first planning aims for steady cool growth.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Should cauliflower be direct sown?</summary>
    <p>Usually not in short seasons. Indoor starts provide a predictable window and earlier establishment.</p>
