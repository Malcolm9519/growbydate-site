  <h2>About Peas</h2>
  <p>
    Peas are a classic cool-season crop that prefers cold spring weather. In frost-first planning, peas are one of the few crops
    that can be direct sown well before last frost if soil is workable.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 50–65°F (10–18°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress:</strong> Above 75°F (24°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 30–35°F (-1–2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Peas tolerate cold better than most crops, but hard freezes can still damage tender growth.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    For spring peas, the window often starts weeks before last frost. The limiting factor is soil workability, not frost risk.
    Early sowing helps peas flower and set pods before summer heat.
  </p>
  <p>
    For fall planning, use first frost as the anchor and treat cutoff dates as conservative—cooling nights can stretch maturity.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Peas are typically direct sown. Transplanting is not common because vines establish quickly when sown in place.

  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun</li>
    <li>Well-drained soil (cold wet soil delays emergence)</li>
    <li>Support for climbing types</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Early varieties (≈55–65 days):</strong> best fit for short springs and fall attempts.</li>
    <li><strong>Main-season varieties (≈65–75 days):</strong> need early sowing to avoid heat.</li>
    <li><strong>Snap/snow vs shelling:</strong> timing is similar; harvest stage differs.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Peas tolerate cool fall nights, but hard freezes at 32°F (0°C) end production. As nights cool and daylight drops,
    maturity often stretches—buffers matter.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can peas be planted before last frost?</summary>
    <p>Yes. Peas tolerate cold and are often sown weeks before last frost when soil is workable.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do peas survive frost?</summary>
    <p>They tolerate cold well, but freezes at 32°F (0°C) or lower can damage growth and end production.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why do peas stop producing in summer?</summary>
    <p>Heat stress. Peas are a cool-season crop; frost-first timing aims to harvest before sustained warmth.</p>
