  <h2>About Kale</h2>

  <p class="tagline">
    Cold-hardy greens with one of the longest harvest windows in short seasons.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Kale is one of the most frost-tolerant vegetables you can grow.</strong>
    It keeps producing in cool weather that slows most crops, and light freezes typically improve flavor rather than causing damage.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 55–70°F (13–21°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress / bitterness risk:</strong> Above 80°F (27°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Light frost tolerance:</strong> 20–28°F (-7 to -2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze point:</strong> 32°F (0°C) (usually not damaging once established)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Kale is unusually forgiving in cold climates. A light freeze at 32°F (0°C) is rarely a problem after plants are established.
    The bigger limitation is that growth slows sharply as temperatures drop and day length shortens.
  </p>

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>

  <p>
    Kale fits naturally into frost-based planning because it tolerates cold and performs best when it matures in cool weather.
    In short seasons, you can run kale as an early spring transplant, a direct-sown spring crop, and a late-summer sowing for fall.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spring transplant approach:</strong> Start indoors 4–6 weeks before your last frost, then transplant around last frost (or slightly before if conditions are mild).</li>
    <li><strong>Spring direct sow:</strong> Sow as soon as soil can be worked, then thin to avoid crowding.</li>
    <li><strong>Fall crop:</strong> Sow in late summer so plants size up before nights become consistently cold. Kale can handle frost, but it needs time to grow before daylight and soil warmth drop.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fine muted">
    In cold regions, kale often “survives” far longer than it actively grows. Plan fall sowing so plants are established well before hard freezes.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Kale can be started indoors or direct sown. Indoor starts help you get earlier harvests and a stronger head start in short seasons.
    Maintain moderate indoor temperatures (60–70°F / 16–21°C) and provide strong light to prevent stretching.
  </p>

  <p>
    Harden off seedlings before transplanting. Kale tolerates cool weather, but a sudden jump from indoor warmth to cold wind can slow growth.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    Kale grows best in full sun to partial sun with consistent moisture. In hot periods, afternoon shade can reduce stress and bitterness.
    Even moisture supports tender leaves and steady regrowth after harvesting.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short seasons, the most important “site” factor is avoiding extreme swings: protect young plants from strong wind and keep watering steady during warm spells.
  </p>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Most kale varieties perform well in cool climates. Choose based on harvest style and speed:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Curly types:</strong> Reliable, sturdy leaves with repeated harvests</li>
    <li><strong>Lacinato (dinosaur):</strong> Tender, flatter leaves; often preferred for cooking</li>
    <li><strong>Russian types:</strong> Often faster and more tolerant of fluctuating fall conditions</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fine muted">
    Baby-leaf harvesting matures sooner than full-size plants and is a strong strategy for short seasons.
  </p>

  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Kale is one of the best crops for riding out fall frost. Light freezes commonly improve flavor.
    The main risk is not frost damage—it’s stalled growth if plants are too small when cold sets in.
  </p>

  <p>
    If hard freezes are approaching and plants are still small, protect them with a simple cover to preserve leaf quality and extend harvest.
    Harvest outer leaves first so the plant continues producing from the center.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Can kale survive a freeze?</h3>
  <p>
    Yes. Established kale often tolerates temperatures well below 32°F (0°C), and light freezes rarely cause harm.
  </p>

  <h3>Why did my kale stop growing in fall?</h3>
  <p>
    Growth slows sharply below about 45°F (7°C) and drops further as day length shortens. Kale may stay alive but add very little new leaf growth.
  </p>

  <h3>Is kale a spring crop or a fall crop?</h3>
  <p>
    Both. Spring kale grows fast in cool weather, while fall kale often tastes sweeter after frosts—just make sure it has time to size up before cold arrives.

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    Kale is a frost-first short-season staple. It tolerates freezing temperatures, thrives in cool weather, and can produce across spring and fall.
    Focus on timing for establishment, keep moisture steady, and treat frost as an advantage—not a threat.
