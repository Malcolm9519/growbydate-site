  <h2>About Broccoli</h2>

  <p class="tagline">
    A cool-season staple that rewards early timing in short seasons.
  </p>

  <p class="lede">
    <strong>Broccoli performs best in cool weather and tolerates light frost.</strong>
    In short growing seasons, the main advantage is that it can be transplanted early. The main risk is heat—warm spells can trigger bolting or loose heads if timing slips.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 60–70°F (16–21°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth threshold:</strong> Below 50°F (10°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress / bolting risk:</strong> Above 75°F (24°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) (usually minor if established)</li>
    <li><strong>Hard freeze damage:</strong> Below 25°F (-4°C)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Broccoli is more cold-tolerant than warm-season vegetables, but young plants still benefit from hardening off.
    Light frost rarely harms established plants. Repeated hard freezes can damage growing points and reduce head quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Heat is the bigger limitation in many short-season climates. Sustained temperatures above 75°F (24°C) during head formation often lead to loose heads or premature flowering.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>

  <p>
    In cold-climate regions, broccoli is usually grown from transplants so plants can establish early and mature before peak heat.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Spring crop:</strong> Start indoors about 6–8 weeks before last frost, then transplant roughly 2–4 weeks before last frost (once soil is workable).</li>
    <li><strong>Fall crop:</strong> Sow or transplant 10–14 weeks before first fall frost so heads form in cooling temperatures.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="fine muted">
    Broccoli can survive light frost, but it still needs time and steady growth to form tight heads. The goal is to mature heads in cool weather—not during heat spikes.
  </p>

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>

  <p>
    Indoor starting improves reliability in short seasons. Keep seedlings under strong light and moderate temperatures (60–70°F / 16–21°C).
    Harden off gradually before transplanting into cool outdoor conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transplant while seedlings are still vigorous and not root-bound. Stalled seedlings often translate into uneven outdoor growth and smaller heads.
  </p>

  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    Broccoli prefers full sun and fertile, well-drained soil with consistent moisture.
    Uneven watering—especially during warm periods—can reduce head quality and increase stress.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short seasons, choose a site that warms early and avoids extreme wind exposure. Cold wind can slow young transplants even when temperatures are technically above freezing.

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    In colder climates, prioritize varieties that mature reliably within your season length.
    Faster varieties (often 55–75 days) reduce the risk of heading up during hot weather.
  </p>

  <p class="fine muted">
    If your summers heat up quickly, early-maturing varieties are usually more dependable than long-season types.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>

  <p>
    Light frost can improve flavor and firmness. However, prolonged temperatures below about 25°F (-4°C) can damage heads and outer leaves.
    If a hard freeze is forecast and heads are mature, harvest early.
  </p>

  <p>
    If heads are still developing, a simple cover can protect plants through brief cold snaps, but deep freezes eventually reduce quality.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3>Can broccoli survive a freeze?</h3>
  <p>
    Light frost is usually fine for established plants, but repeated hard freezes below about 25°F (-4°C can cause damage).
  </p>

  <h3>Why did my broccoli bolt?</h3>
  <p>
    Heat is the most common trigger. Sustained temperatures above about 75°F (24°C) can push plants to flower early.
  </p>

  <h3>Can I direct sow broccoli in a short season?</h3>
  <p>
    You can, but indoor starts are often more reliable because they let you transplant early and mature heads before heat arrives.

  <h2>Summary</h2>

  <p>
    Broccoli is a frost-aware, cool-season crop that thrives when it matures in steady spring or fall temperatures.
    Start early, transplant on time, and treat heat—not frost—as the main risk in short growing seasons.
