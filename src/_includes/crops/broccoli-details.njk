  <h2>About Broccoli</h2>

  <p class="tagline">
    A head-forming brassica that depends on steady growth and cool timing.

    <strong>Broccoli rewards consistency more than speed.</strong>
    In cold-climate gardens, it performs best when it grows without interruption through mild spring temperatures or gradual fall cooling. Sudden heat or stalled early growth often results in smaller or looser heads.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike leafy greens, broccoli must build enough leaf mass before forming a tight central head.
    That means your planting window isn’t just about surviving frost — it’s about giving plants uninterrupted cool weeks to size up before temperature swings interfere with head formation.

  <p>
    In short seasons, the strategic advantage is early transplanting into workable soil, followed by steady growth during moderate daytime temperatures.
