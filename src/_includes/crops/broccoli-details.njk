<h2>About Broccoli</h2>
<p>
Broccoli is a cool-season brassica that performs best when it matures in steady, moderate temperatures. In cold-climate gardens, it is one of the most reliable spring and fall crops because it tolerates light frost and prefers conditions that would slow down warm-season vegetables.
</p>
<p>
In short growing seasons, success depends on starting early, transplanting on time, and avoiding the rapid heat swings that trigger bolting.
</p>

<h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 60–70°F (16–21°C)</li>
<li><strong>Slow growth threshold:</strong> Below 50°F (10°C)</li>
<li><strong>Heat stress / bolting risk:</strong> Above 75°F (24°C)</li>
<li><strong>Light frost tolerance:</strong> 28–30°F (-2 to -1°C)</li>
<li><strong>Hard freeze damage:</strong> Below 25°F (-4°C)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Broccoli handles light spring frosts well once established. Seedlings can tolerate brief dips below freezing, but repeated hard freezes may damage the growing point.
</p>

<p>
Heat is the larger threat. Extended temperatures above 75°F (24°C) can cause loose heads or premature flowering.
</p>

<h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
<p>
In cold-climate regions, broccoli is typically started indoors 6–8 weeks before the average last frost. Transplanting often occurs 2–4 weeks before last frost once soil is workable and daytime temperatures are consistently above 45°F (7°C).
</p>

<p>
For fall harvest, sow or transplant 10–14 weeks before your first fall frost so head development occurs during cooling temperatures rather than peak summer heat.
</p>

<p>
Because frost tolerance is moderate, broccoli can extend the shoulder season on both ends of the growing window.
</p>

<h2>Seed Starting</h2>
<p>
Indoor starting improves reliability in short seasons. Maintain seedling temperatures around 60–70°F (16–21°C) and provide strong light to prevent stretching.
</p>
<p>
Harden off gradually before transplanting into cool outdoor conditions. Broccoli transplants are generally resilient if not root-bound.
</p>

<h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
<p>
Broccoli prefers full sun and evenly moist, well-drained soil. Consistent moisture is especially important during head formation. Uneven watering combined with heat increases stress.
</p>

<h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
<p>
Choose varieties with 55–75 day maturity for short seasons. Faster varieties reduce exposure to summer heat and improve reliability in regions with early fall frost.
</p>

<h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
<p>
Light frost can improve flavor and firmness. However, extended temperatures below 25°F (-4°C) may damage developing heads. Harvest mature heads before deep freezes.
</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can broccoli survive a freeze?</h3>
<p>
It tolerates light frost down to about 28°F (-2°C), but sustained hard freezes can damage plants.
</p>

<h3>Why are my broccoli heads loose?</h3>
<p>
Loose heads often result from temperatures above 75°F (24°C) during formation.
</p>

<h3>Is broccoli better in spring or fall?</h3>
<p>
Both can work in cold climates, but fall crops often produce more consistent heads because temperatures gradually cool instead of spike.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Broccoli thrives in cool conditions and tolerates light frost, making it a dependable crop for short seasons. Start early, transplant into cool soil, and prioritize maturity before sustained summer heat.
