<h2>Best Varieties for Short Seasons</h2>
<p>
        Look for early-maturing broccoli and varieties that form heads reliably in cool conditions.
      </p>
<ul>
<li>Early varieties (around 60–70 days)</li>
<li>Compact types for tight spacing and faster harvest</li>
<li>Cold-tolerant selections for fall planting</li>
</ul>
<p class="fine muted">
        Broccoli timing is sensitive: too hot can cause loose heads; too cold can slow growth.

<h2>Common Short-Season Mistakes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Starting too late.</strong> Heat stress can hit before heads form.</li>
<li><strong>Letting plants dry out.</strong> Even moisture supports steady head development.</li>
<li><strong>Overcrowding.</strong> Tight spacing can reduce head size in short seasons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fall Planning Notes</h2>
<p>
        Fall broccoli can be excellent if planted early enough. It needs time to size up before cold slows growth.
      </p>
<ul>
<li>Start fall broccoli earlier than you would for leafy greens</li>
<li>Use protection to reduce frost stress and wind damage</li>
<li>Harvest promptly at tight head stage for best quality</li>
</ul>
