  <h2>About Onions</h2>
  <p>
    Onions are a long-runway crop. In short seasons, the core requirement is time: start early indoors and transplant into cool spring conditions
    so plants can build leaf mass before bulbing.

  <h2>Cold Sensitivity & Temperature Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Optimal growth:</strong> 55–75°F (13–24°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Slow growth:</strong> Below 45°F (7°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Heat stress:</strong> Above 85°F (29°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Cold stress:</strong> Around 35°F (2°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Freeze damage:</strong> 32°F (0°C) or lower</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Established onions tolerate cool weather, but freezing temperatures can damage foliage and slow development.

  <h2>Frost Timing & Planting Window</h2>
  <p>
    In frost-first planning, onions are transplanted early—often before last frost if weather is stable and soil is workable. The goal is to maximize early-season growth.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fall timing is about finishing bulbing before cold nights slow growth, not planting late in the season.

  <h2>Seed Starting</h2>
  <p>
    Onions are commonly started indoors well ahead of last frost because they need time to develop. Short seasons benefit from a steady, early indoor start window.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Indoor growth temps:</strong> ~65–75°F (18–24°C)</li>
    <li><strong>Goal at transplant:</strong> sturdy seedlings, not overgrown plants</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Soil & Site Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Full sun for best bulbing</li>
    <li>Well-drained soil (cold, wet soil delays growth)</li>
    <li>Consistent moisture during early growth</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Variety Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Daylength matters:</strong> choose types suited to your latitude for reliable bulbing.</li>
    <li><strong>Earlier maturity (≈90–105 days):</strong> better fit for short seasons.</li>
    <li><strong>Longer maturity (≈105–120 days):</strong> requires early transplant timing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Fall Frost Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    Onions tolerate cool fall weather, but growth slows as nights cool. A hard freeze at 32°F (0°C) can damage foliage and shorten finishing time.

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <details>
    <summary>Can onions handle frost?</summary>
    <p>Established onions tolerate light frost, but freezes at 32°F (0°C) can damage foliage and slow finishing.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Why start onions so early indoors?</summary>
    <p>Bulb size depends on leaf growth before bulbing. Short seasons need an early runway.</p>
  </details>

  <details>
    <summary>Do onions need warm soil like warm-season crops?</summary>
    <p>No. They tolerate cool weather, but cold wet soil slows establishment and growth.</p>
